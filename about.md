Introduction
---

1. A [GNU/Linux][GNU/Linux] user.
2. Have used [LibreOffice][LibreOffice] for homework.
3. Some differences in the appearance of documents across M\$ and
\*nix.
4. Use $\rm \LaTeX$ & HTML for consistency.[^markdown]
5. Use [Vim] for efficient editing of source code.
6. Acquired knowledge in these areas.
7. Forgotten some of them since I'm *not* a student in IT.
8. Realised the need for writing down the code.
9. Hand-written notes are *not* neat and *can't* be easily found and
searched after years.
10. Make notes for future reference here.

I have *no* money to hire any IT support person, so I have to support
myself.

[^markdown]:
    Finally, I've found out that writing in [Markdown][Markdown] is
    **much easier**.

As the server on which I put my notes is going to close down, I put it
here.

- My thoughts on ${_nC_r}$: [PDF][ncr], [source][ncr_src]

My Old Blogs
---

Before blogging using Octopress, I tried WordPress and Blogger.

1. [My old Blogger blog](http://blogue-un.blogspot.hk/)
2. [My old WordPress blog](http://blogueun.wordpress.com/)

Since I love Vim and Markdown **very much**, I tried using
[UltraBlog.vim][UB] to post essays on WordPress.  However, when it
came to posting code lists, especially the HTML ones, I experienced
lots of problems.  Moreover, it's *inconvenient* to create posts
containing embedded documents and custom scripts.

[GitHub pages][GitHub_pages] provide a greater degree of freedom, but
require knowledge in [Git][Git].  This is not so hard.  With Git
skills, you can post HTML files.  For general users who want to write
words, but *not* CSS, a blogging template for GitHub pages is needed.
Finally, I use [Octopress][Octopress].

My Videos

I have made only two, and they're on YouTube.

1. [Efficient LaTeX Editing with Vim](http://youtu.be/y67t-05nFD0)
2. [Easy Citing in APA Style with Vim-LaTeX](http://youtu.be/ly8BlePO4ws)

My Project Pages
---

<del>
Using Octopress to create **both** a blog and a GitHub project page
under the **same** host (http://username.github.io) is **too
difficult** since they share the **same** `source` folder.
</del>

*Not* being an IT student, I will get pretty project page template set
up with several clicks on GitHub's online platform.[^not_it_student]
For details, you may refer to
[*Instantly Beautiful Project Pages*][inst_pp] written by Boxer.

1. [Hello-World][Hello-World]: A testing repository.
2. [pandoc_slides][pandoc_slides]: A repository for some of my slides.
3. [i_dont_use_word][i_dont_use_word]: Another repository for hosting
a slide created easily **without** M$ Office.
4. [blog2][blog2]: A testing repository which contains program code in
the `master` branch and a GitHub project page built with Jekyll
Bootstrap in the `gh-pages` branch.
