      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>This Wednesday, I read a proof about the non-separability of
$\ell^\infty$ spaces.  To simplify things, I assume that it’s defined
on sequences.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  L^\infty \triangleq \{ (x_n)_{n \in \N} \mid \exists\,M \ge 0
  \text{ such that } \forall\,n \in \N, \abs{x_n} \le M \}
\]
</div>

<p>I have written down the uncountable set (see Cantor’s diagonal
argument)</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  D \triangleq \{ (x_n)_{n \in \N} \mid \forall\,n \in \N, x_n=\pm1 \}
\]
</div>

<p>in my notes.  I understand</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  B(x,1) \cap B(y,1) = \varnothing \quad \forall \, x,y \in D
  \text{ with } x \ne y.
\]
</div>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Then, my teacher said that the reason for the non-separability of
$\ell^\infty$ was like the Pigeon-Hole Principle.  I got puzzled when
I was revising the proof.  In fact, in the above equation, an element
in a <em>dense</em> set $C$ can be found in each open ball $B(x,1)$.  Since
the open balls $B(x,1)$ are <em>disjoint</em>, $C$ has <em>uncountably</em> many
elements.  Hence, $\ell^\infty$ is non-separable.</p>

<p>One knows that if a space is separable, we <em>can’t</em> insert a
non-separable subspace into it.  The above property of $\ell^\infty$
serves as a concrete example of this fact.</p>

<p>It’s easy to show that a space having a Schauder basis is separable.
Thus, we can conclude that $\ell^\infty$ <em>don’t</em> possess any Schauder
basis.</p>

<p>In fact, we have a more <em>direct</em> approach to the absence of Schauder
basis in $\ell^\infty$.  This will be discussed in my next post.</p>

    <id>https://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2016/03/21/approximation-of-a-bounded-simple-function-by-a-continuous-function</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Today, I was puzzled by a <em>remark</em> of a proof that a simple function
$f:[a,b] \to \R$ is equal to a step function $\psi:[a,b] \to \R$
(resp. a continuous function $g:[a,b] \to \R$) except on a set of
arbitrarily small measure $\epsilon$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $m \le f(x) \le M \;\forall\, x\in [a,b]$, then $\bar{\psi}
\triangleq (m \vee \psi) \wedge M$ and $\bar{g} \triangleq (m \vee
g) \wedge M$ are step function and continuous function which satisfy
$m \le \bar{\psi}$ and $m \le \bar{g} \le M$ so that $f =
\bar{\psi}$ and $f = \bar{g}$ except on a set of measure less than
$\epsilon$ respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can verify the above remark, but I wonder <em>why</em> we need to define
$\bar{\psi}$ and $\bar{g}$ so as to guarantee that they are bounded
below and above by $m$ and $M$ respectively.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Write</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  f = \sum_{j = 1}^m a_j \chi_{E_j \cap [a,b]},
\]
</div>

<p><span class="myeqn">
where $E_j$ is measurable for each $j = 1,\dots,m$, so that we can
consider $E_j$.  Note that the $E_j$'s are not necessarily disjoint,
but who cares?  By drawing a simple figure of $E_j \cap [a,b]$ and
$U_j$, which is a finite disjoint union of open intervals obtained by
applying Littlewood's First Principle, I realised that I should try
constructing a simple function $f$ while focusing on $(E_j \cap [a,b])
\triangle U_j$.
</span></p>

<p>In the proof, to deal with the summation sign, we use a union sign.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  f = \psi \triangleq \sum_{j = 1}^m a_j \chi_{U_j} \text{ except on }
  \bigcup_{j = 1}^m [(E_j \cap [a,b]) \triangle U_j]
\]
</div>

<p>If we’re given that $m \le f \le M$, to find <span class="myeqn">$x \in \bigcup_{j = 1}^m [(E_j \cap [a,b]) \triangle
U_j]$</span> so that $\psi(x) &lt; m$ or $\psi(x) &gt; M$, we need to have
<em>overlapping</em> of <span class="myeqn">$E_i \cap [a,b]$ and
$E_j \cap [a,b]$, so that $\chi_{(E_i \cap [a,b]) \triangle U_i} +
\chi_{(E_j \cap [a,b]) \triangle U_j}$ will give us something
interesting.</span></p>

<p>To see <em>necessity</em> of the introduction of $\bar{\psi}$, consider <span class="myeqn">$f \triangleq \chi_{(0,1)} + \chi_{(1,2)}$
and $\psi \triangleq \chi_{[0,1]} + \chi_{[1,2]}$.  Then $f = \psi$
except on $\{0,1,2\}$ and $0 \le f \le 1$, but $\psi(1) = 2
&gt; 1$.</span>  One can easily transform a step function into a
piecewise linear (i.e. continuous) function $g$.</p>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>It’s very difficult for a function to be continuous.  The result
provides a step for proving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusin's_theorem">Lusin’s Theorem</a>, which says that
a measurable function can be approximated by a sequence of continuous
function.  <q cite="http://evchk.wikia.com/wiki/Wow!_Old_news_is_so_exciting!">Old

<p>I tried <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1635782/290189">this Mathematics Stack Exchange question</a> by
drawing a Venn Diagram.</p>

</picture>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>A downvote was quickly casted on my answer below which a comment about
the non-existence of a Venn diagram with 4 sets was left.  I clicked
on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/825984/290189">the link to another question</a> in that comment to
understand why I got this downvote: <strong>Why a 4-set Venn diagram
<em>doesn’t</em> exist?</strong></p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>I understood the arguments of Joebot’s answer up to the “application
of binomial theorem”, but I <em>didn’t</em> understand the Euler’s formular.
In fact, for any 3-D object with edges, vertices and faces, one can
represent it by a 2-D planar graph, on which the outermost region also
represents one of the faces of the 3-D object.  Thus, the Euler’s
formula for any 3-D object can be seen on a 2-D planar graph.  I’m
amazed that this can be proved by mathematical induction on the number
of regions on the 2-D graph (which corresponds to that of faces of the
3-D object).  IMHO, this should be taught in high schools as examples
of mathematical induction, instead of divisibility of integers, which
can be done better using modular arithmetic.</p>

      <link href="https://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2016/02/07/closedness-vs-completeness/"/>
    
    <updated>2016-02-07T17:50:37+08:00</updated>
    <id>https://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2016/02/07/closedness-vs-completeness</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>To prove a limit, we need to find a number before.  The definition
gives us <em>no</em> hints on how to find it.  Cauchy’s Criterion for
convergence is a good method for finding it numerically in “certain
spaces” (e.g. $\R,L^p,L^\infty$) because the definition is
<em>intrinsic</em>.</p>

<p>Unluckily, there’re some “strange spaces” where Cauchy’s Criterion
<em>isn’t</em> enough to give a convergence.  The simplest one is $\Q$
equipped with the usual metric in $\R$.</p>

<p><span class="myeqn">
One knows that an incomplete metric space $X$ can extended to form a
complete one $X^*$ (which is unique up to isometric isomorphism) so
that $\iota(X)$ is dense in $X^*$.  That is, $\overline{\iota(X)} =
X^*$.
</span></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>I confused $\overline{X}$ with $X^*$.  In other words, what’s the
difference between the completion of $X$ and the closure of $X$?</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<h3 id="general-answer">General answer</h3>

<p>To see this, we note that the closedness of a set is discussed
<em>relative to another set</em>, so if one stays inside the incomplete space
$X$, then one notices that <strong>$X$ is closed in $X$</strong>.  However, even
though one <em>doesn’t</em> know about $X^*$, one still realises that $X$ is
incomplete.</p>

<p>If one becomes wiser and seeks to “complete a given Cauchy sequence”
(i.e. find a limit for a Cauchy sequence in $X$), it’s <em>impossible to
live inside $X$</em>—one needs to escape from $X$ to $X^*$ so as to
enjoy more freedom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claim: $X$ <em>isn’t</em> closed in $X^*$.</p>

  <p>Approach: We <em>won’t</em> start from the topological definition (open
complement).  Instead, we’ll argue with sequences.</p>

  <p>Proof: Since $X$ is <em>incomplete</em>, there exists a Cauchy sequence
$(x_n)$ in $X$ so that it has <em>no</em> limit in $X$.  The completeness
of $X^*$ is applied to construct a limit $x$ in $X^*$.  If one
allows $X$ to be closed, then $x$ will stay inside $X$, which
contradicts the fact that $(x_n)$ has <em>no</em> limit in $X$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though living in $X$ is sad, and it seems to be hard to escape
(because $X$ is closed in $X$), if one has a chance to travel outside,
one will see that $X$ is <em>not</em> really closed—it is possible to find
a sequence $(x_n)$ to escape from $X$.</p>

<h3 id="specific-example">Specific example</h3>

<p>$\Q$ is closed in $\Q$, but it <em>isn’t</em> closed in $\R$.  Therefore, the
concept of closedness depends on the bigger space.  However, the
concept of completeness only depends on $\Q$ itself.</p>
