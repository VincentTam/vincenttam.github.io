      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this Chinese New Year holiday, I read E. Artin’s proof of the
existence of algebraic closure, which could be found online.<sup id="fnref:milne"><a href="#fn:milne" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Two days ago, I was stuck at the point where the ideal $I$ of
$F[\dots,X_f,\dots]$ was defined.  I <em>mistakenly</em> thought that one
needed to fix an arbitrary polynomial $f$ in the polynomial ring
$F[X]$ first because the goal of this theorem is to show the
existence of an algebraic field extension $E$ of $F$ so that $E$ is
algebraically closed, and for any nonconstant polynomial $f$ in
$F[X]$, $f$ has a root (a.k.a. zero) in $E$.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

<p>This noon, I finally saw “indexed by $f$”, and I found I should
interpret “the ideal generated by $f(X_f)$” in this way:</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
I := \left\{\sum_{m = 1}^n g_m (\dots,X_f,\dots) f_m (X_{f_m}) : n \in
\integers_{&gt;0}, f_i \in F[X], g_i (\dots,X_f,\dots) \forall i \in
\{1,\dots,n\}\right\},
\]
</div>

<p>instead of viewing $f(X)$ as a <em>fixed</em> polynomial in $F[X]$.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just read a statement which asserts that a subring isomorphic to
$\integers$ or $\integers_n$ can be found in any ring $R$ with unity.
The proof which is based on a ring homomorphism $\phi:\integers\to R$
defined by $\phi(m)=m\cdot 1$ <em>isn’t</em> difficult to read.</p>

<p>I used fifteen minutes to think of why one needs a <em>subring</em> inside
the ring $R$ with unity, instead of $R$.  After I’ve come up with
<span class="myeqn">$R=\langle1,\frac{1}{2}\rangle=\left\{\frac{a}{2^b}\mid a
\in \integers, b \in\integers_{\ge 0} \right\}$</span>, I start this

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the day before yesterday, I read a proof about the transitivity of
characteristic subgroups.  The proof <em>shouldn’t</em> be too difficult.
The key step is just to create a restriction automorphism.</p>

<p>Suppose $K\le H\le G$, and $f\in \Aut(G)$.  Then $f(H)=H$.  Define the
restriction of $f$ on $H$ as $g:H\to H$ such that $g(h)=f(h)\forall h
\in H$.  Clearly, $g\in \Aut(H)$.</p>

<p>I <em>couldn’t</em> understand why $g(K)=K$.  I googled “strongly normal
transitivity”, but <em>couldn’t</em> find anything relevant.  I changed the
words, and found <a href="https://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Characteristic_Subgroup">the proof on ProofWiki</a>.  Then I realised why I
got stuck: when I wrote the definition of characteristic subgroup
symbolically, I <em>didn’t</em> pay enough attention to ‘∀’.</p>

      <link href="http://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2014/12/30/read-an-alternative-proof-of-the-extreme-value-theorem-using-tagged-partitions/"/>

    <id>http://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2014/12/30/read-an-alternative-proof-of-the-extreme-value-theorem-using-tagged-partitions</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Last Saturday, I read an article on using gauges defined on a close
and bounded interval $I$ (i.e. strictly postive functions over $I$)
and tagged partitions to prove the Extreme Value Theorem.<sup id="fnref:src"><a href="#fn:src" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
Though the full text is <em>not</em> free, one can preview the first page, on
which an attractive introduction is found.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>In ordinary proofs of the Extreme Value Theorem, one makes use of the
fact that continuous functions defined on $I$ are bounded, which is
proved by the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem, which has to be proved by
either the Monotone Convergence Theorem or the Nested Interval
Theorem.  A student who prepares for an exam in math analysis will
revise the lengthy proofs of these theorems.</p>

<p>However, the alternative proof of the Extreme Value Theorem is just a
proof by contradiction making use of basic properties of $\delta$-fine
partitions and the fact that continuous functions defined on $I$ are
bounded, which is proved by basic properties of $\delta$-fine
partitions only.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Once one accepts that for any gauge $\delta$ on $I$, $I$ is
$\delta$-fine, one can start reading the proof.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>In the author’s proof, it’s said that if $f$ is a continuous function
defined on $I$, <span class="myeqn">$K:=\sup\{f(x):x\in
I\}$</span>, and $\forall t\in I, \exists a(t),\delta(t)&gt;0$ such that
$|x-t|&lt;\delta(t)$ and $x\in I$, then $f(x)&lt;K-a(t)$.</p>

<p>Spending too much time on
<a href="/blog/2014/12/29/octopress-pagespeed-jquery-and-fancybox/">boosting the PageSpeed of the homepage of this blog</a>, I
forgot a result obtained from an elementary exercise on continuous
functions, and was stuck at this point.</p>

<p>I tried writing inequalities for two hours, but I got <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I looked at the graph, and solved the problem quickly by setting
$\epsilon:=K-f(t)-a(t)$. If $|x-t|&lt;\delta(t)$ and $x\in I$,</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x)-f(t)\le|f(x)-f(t)|&lt;&amp;\epsilon=K-f(t)-a(t)&#92;&#92;
f(x)&lt;&amp;K-a(t)
\end{aligned}
\]

    <updated>2014-12-09T15:29:09+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2014/12/09/a-group-of-689-elements</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month ago, I took a test and was asked whether “a group of 689
elements is closed under the group operation”.  The question is
<em>trivial</em>, but one can discover another question: <strong>Does such a group
exists?</strong></p>

<p>In order to “proceed with with my work”, I <em>temporarily accepted</em> the
existence fo swuch a group during the test.  However, even though I
got the question right and earned some marks for that, I <em>didn’t</em>
think that this is <em>true</em> mathematics.  To say that one <em>knows</em> this
quoted statement, one has to follow the <em>“international standard”</em> of
a group and make <em>rigourous arguements</em> from the <em>“basic laws”</em> to
prove the existence of such a group.</p>

<p>Thinking that the group of 689 elements <em>isn’t</em> useful, I put that
problem aside.  After a fortnight, I came up with an answer:
<span class="myeqn">$\integers_{13} \times \integers_{53}
\cong \integers_{689}$</span>.</p>
