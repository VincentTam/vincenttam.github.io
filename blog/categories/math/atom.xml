      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose we have a field $F$ of characteristic $p$ and a degree $n$
irreducible polynomial $f \in F[x]$.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
f(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_i x^i \text{, where } a_i \in F \,\forall i =
0,1,\dots,n.
\]
</div>

<p>One can find a root $\alpha \notin F$ of $f$ in a field extension $E$
of $F$ by Kronecker’s Theorem.  Then $f(\alpha) = 0$. <strong>How about the
other $n - 1$ roots of $f$?</strong></p>

<p>Half a month ago, I <em>couldn’t</em> find out the answer directly — I used
the fact that all finite fields of order $p^n$ were isomorphic to
$\fields_{p^n}$, which was the collection of roots of $x^{p^n} - x$
in $\integers_p$ in $\overline{\integers_p}$.  However, this makes
use of <em>too many</em> abstract facts.</p>

<p>Yesterday night, by computing the $p$-th power of an element $\beta$
in $E$, I finally know the direct way of finding the other $n - 1$
roots of $f$ in $E$.  Let $b_0,\dots,b_n \in F$ such that</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\beta = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} b_i \alpha^i.
\]
</div>

<p>Compute the $p$-th power of $\beta$.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\beta^p = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} b_i \alpha^i)^p = \sum_{k_0,\dots,k_{n
- 1}} \frac{p!}{\prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} k_i!} \prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (b_i
  \alpha^i)^{k_i},
\]
</div>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{equation}
\text{ where } 0 \le k_i \le p \,\forall i = 0,\dots,n \text{ and }
\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} k_i = p. \label{eq:cond}
\end{equation}
</div>

<p>Case 1: $\exists k_j = p$, then $k_i = 0 \,\forall i \ne j$.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\frac{p!}{\prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} k_i!} \prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (b_i
\alpha^i)^{k_i} = 1 \cdot (b_j \alpha^j)^{k_j} = b_j \alpha^{pj}
\]
</div>

<p>Note that one can prove that $\forall b \in F, b^p = b$ by induction.</p>

<p>Case 2: $k_i \ne p \,\forall i = 0,\dots,n$.  Since $p$ is a prime,</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\frac{p!}{\prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} k_i!} = 0 \text{ in } \integers_p
\]
</div>

<p>Since one only has $n$ choices of $k_0,\dots,k_{n - 1}$ which
satisfy \eqref{eq:cond}, we conclude that</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{equation}
\beta^p = (\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} b_i \alpha^i)^p = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}
b_i^p \alpha^{pi} \label{eq:powp}
\end{equation}
</div>

<p>Since $\alpha$ is a root of $f$ in $E$, $(f(\alpha))^p = 0$.
Replacing “$n - 1$” by “$n$” in the derivation of \eqref{eq:powp}, one
gets</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
(f(\alpha))^p = (\sum_{i = 0}^n a_i \alpha^i)^p = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_i
\alpha^{pi} = f(\alpha^p) = 0
\]
</div>

<p>Therefore, <em>without</em> learning induction, one can sense that
$f(\alpha^{p^m}) = 0 \,\forall m \in \naturals$.  That’s not the end.
Since the degree of $f$ is $n$, we expect to that the number of roots
of $f$ is <em>finite</em>.  Since we expect $n$ roots of $f$, we hope that
$\alpha^{p^m}$ will repeat itself for sufficiently large $m$.  This
hope comes true due to Lagrange’s Theorem — $|F^\times| = p^n -
1$, so $\alpha^{p^n - 1} = 1$.</p>

<p><del>
Unluckily, I’ve just found out that $f$ <em>has</em> some root $\alpha’$
which <em>doesn’t</em> hit either one of
$\alpha,\alpha^p,\alpha^{p^2},\dots,\alpha^{p^{n - 1}}$.  For example,
if one sets $f(x) := x^{p^2} - x \in \integers_p[x]$ and let
$\alpha$ be a root of $f$ in $\overline{\integers_p}$, then it’s
trivial that $\alpha^{p^2} = \alpha$, thus the collection of the
$p^m$-th power of $\alpha$ is just $\left\{ \alpha,\alpha^p
\right\}$.  (i.e. $\left\{ \alpha^{p^m} \mid m \in \naturals
\right\} = \left\{ \alpha,\alpha^p \right\}$)  Nevertheless, $f$
should have $p^2$ roots in $\overline{\integers_p}$.
</del></p>

<p>Hence, I <em>didn’t</em> succeed in answering <strong>the above bolded question</strong>,
but I still learn something about the roots of an irreducible
polynomial in an algebraic extension.</p>

<hr />
<p>(Added on MAR 18, 2015)</p>

<p>With the results from splitting fields, <strong>this question</strong> can be
answered immediately.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was a secondary school student, I was quite satisfied with this
proof of Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp; (\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i b_i)^2 \le (\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2)(\sum_{j = 1}^n
b_j^2) &#92;&#92;

1}^n a_i^2)(\sum_{j = 1}^n b_j^2) &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i a_j b_i b_j \le \sum_{i = 1}^n
\sum_{j = 1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i a_j b_i b_j \le \sum_{i = 1}^n
\sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} \left( a_i^2 b_j^2 + \frac{1}{2} a_j^2
b_i^2 \right) &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} (a_i^2 b_j^2 - 2 a_i
b_j \cdot a_j b_i + a_j^2 b_i^2) \ge 0 &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2
\ge 0
\end{aligned}
\]
</div>

<p>Equality holds if and only if <span class="myeqn">$\forall i,j = 1,\dots,n, a_i b_j - a_j b_i = 0$</span>.
I was so happy that I <em>didn’t</em> think of further generalisations.  I
<em>didn’t</em> realise that the inequality can be more concisely written as
$\langle \vect{a}, \vect{b} \rangle^2 \le \norm{\vect{a}}^2
\norm{\vect{b}}^2$, where <span class="myeqn">$\vect{a} =
(a_1,\cdots,a_n), \vect{b} = (b_1,\cdots,b_n) \in \reals^n$</span></p>

<p>This Friday evening, I did a question about the integral version of
the inequality.  After spending hours to come up with an idea, I
realised why I needed to learn inner product spaces.  The very first
version of the inequality that I learnt has too many summation signs,
and it <em>can’t</em> be easily generalised to other spaces.  The second
proof of the <em>same</em> inequality that I learnt makes use of the
determinant of a quadratic polynomial $p(t) = \norm{\vect{u} - t
\vect{v}}^2$.  That proof is much more elegant, and it helped me a lot
while I was doing that question.  When equality holds, it’s very hard
to imagine what happens by looking at the original equality.  However,
if we convert it into the determinant of $p(t)$, then one quickly
knows that this is equivalent to $p(t) = 0$, and can easily conclude
that equality holds if and only if the two functions $f$ and $g$
satisfy $f \equiv k g$ for some $k \in \reals$ for almost all
points.<sup id="fnref:rmk"><a href="#fn:rmk" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>To be more precise, if one accepts that the space $C([a,b])$ of
continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval
$[a,b]$ in an inner product space, and $f,g \in C([a,b])$,
then the condition “for almost all points” can be dropped.  If we
<em>don’t</em> to want be to so strict on the functions $f$ and $g$
defined on $[a,b]$, and we just say that $f$ and $g$ are
integrable functions defined on $[a,b]$, then we have to accept
the fact that $\displaystyle \int_a^b f^2 = 0$ <em>doesn’t</em> imply
that $f \equiv 0$. <a href="#fnref:rmk" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday evening, I saw a <strong>local ring</strong> in a commutative ring
with unity for the first time.  At the first glance, I <em>didn’t</em> know
how to make use of it’s definition — a ring that has only one
maximal ideal — to answer a question.  If I was given a local ring
$R$, then should I first assume that there’s a maximal ideal $M$, and
then construct another proper ideal $I$ of $R$ so that no proper
ideals of $R$ contained $I$ except for $I$ itself?  I got stuck at
this point for almost an hour, and <em>couldn’t</em> write down something
more for that question.</p>

<p>I finally read another half of the question, and understood the
statement of the whole question.  It would be impossible for me to do
the question <em>without</em> knowing the proper ideal that consisted merely
of elements of R which <em>don’t</em> have a multiplicative inverse.</p>

<p>After I had proved the statement in that question, I was still not
sure whether such a ring <em>exists</em>.  I <em>couldn’t</em> give an example of a
local ring.  This evening, I found it in Wikipedia, and realised that
even though I had already convinced myself that a finite field $F$ of
prime characteristic $p$ has an algebraic closure <span class="myeqn">$\displaystyle \overline{F} = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty
\fields_{p^i}$</span>, I still <em>didn’t</em> know many properties of the
structure of fields.<sup id="fnref:alg_closure"><a href="#fn:alg_closure" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  The simplest example of a local
ring is a field, which has only the trivial ideal <span class="myeqn">$\{0\}$</span> as its proper ideal.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this Chinese New Year holiday, I read E. Artin’s proof of the
existence of algebraic closure, which could be found online.<sup id="fnref:milne"><a href="#fn:milne" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Two days ago, I was stuck at the point where the ideal $I$ of
$F[\dots,X_f,\dots]$ was defined.  I <em>mistakenly</em> thought that one
needed to fix an arbitrary polynomial $f$ in the polynomial ring
$F[X]$ first because the goal of this theorem is to show the
existence of an algebraic field extension $E$ of $F$ so that $E$ is
algebraically closed, and for any nonconstant polynomial $f$ in
$F[X]$, $f$ has a root (a.k.a. zero) in $E$.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

<p>This noon, I finally saw “indexed by $f$”, and I found I should
interpret “the ideal generated by $f(X_f)$” in this way:</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
I := \left\{\sum_{m = 1}^n g_m (\dots,X_f,\dots) f_m (X_{f_m}) : n \in
\integers_{&gt;0}, f_i \in F[X], g_i (\dots,X_f,\dots) \forall i \in
\{1,\dots,n\}\right\},
\]
</div>

<p>instead of viewing $f(X)$ as a <em>fixed</em> polynomial in $F[X]$.</p>
