      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was a secondary school student, I was quite satisfied with this
proof of Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp; (\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i b_i)^2 \le (\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2)(\sum_{j = 1}^n
b_j^2) &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; (\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i b_i) (\sum_{j = 1}^n a_j b_j) \le (\sum_{i =
1}^n a_i^2)(\sum_{j = 1}^n b_j^2) &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i a_j b_i b_j \le \sum_{i = 1}^n
\sum_{j = 1}^n a_i^2 b_j^2 &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n a_i a_j b_i b_j \le \sum_{i = 1}^n
\sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} \left( a_i^2 b_j^2 + \frac{1}{2} a_j^2
b_i^2 \right) &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} (a_i^2 b_j^2 - 2 a_i
b_j \cdot a_j b_i + a_j^2 b_i^2) \ge 0 &#92;&#92;
\iff&amp; \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i)^2
\ge 0
\end{aligned}
\]
</div>

<p>Equality holds if and only if <span class="myeqn">$\forall i,j = 1,\dots,n, a_i b_j - a_j b_i = 0$</span>.
I was so happy that I <em>didn’t</em> think of further generalisations.  I
<em>didn’t</em> realise that the inequality can be more concisely written as
$\langle \vect{a}, \vect{b} \rangle^2 \le \norm{\vect{a}}^2
\norm{\vect{b}}^2$, where <span class="myeqn">$\vect{a} =
(a_1,\cdots,a_n), \vect{b} = (b_1,\cdots,b_n) \in \reals^n$</span></p>

<p>This Friday evening, I did a question about the integral version of
the inequality.  After spending hours to come up with an idea, I
realised why I needed to learn inner product spaces.  The very first
version of the inequality that I learnt has too many summation signs,
and it <em>can’t</em> be easily generalised to other spaces.  The second
proof of the <em>same</em> inequality that I learnt makes use of the
determinant of a quadratic polynomial $p(t) = \norm{\vect{u} - t
\vect{v}}^2$.  That proof is much more elegant, and it helped me a lot
while I was doing that question.  When equality holds, it’s very hard
to imagine what happens by looking at the original equality.  However,
if we convert it into the determinant of $p(t)$, then one quickly
knows that this is equivalent to $p(t) = 0$, and can easily conclude
that equality holds if and only if the two functions $f$ and $g$
satisfy $f \equiv k g$ for some $k \in \reals$ for almost all
points.<sup id="fnref:rmk"><a href="#fn:rmk" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<hr />
<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:rmk">

      <p>To be more precise, if one accepts that the space $C([a,b])$ of
continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval
$[a,b]$ in an inner product space, and $f,g \in C([a,b])$,
then the condition “for almost all points” can be dropped.  If we
<em>don’t</em> to want be to so strict on the functions $f$ and $g$
defined on $[a,b]$, and we just say that $f$ and $g$ are
integrable functions defined on $[a,b]$, then we have to accept
the fact that $\displaystyle \int_a^b f^2 = 0$ <em>doesn’t</em> imply
that $f \equiv 0$. <a href="#fnref:rmk" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, I did a convolution integral to show that a
finite sum of i.i.d. $X_i \sim \Exp(\lambda)$ is Gamma distributed.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
\begin{aligned}
f_{X_{i_1}} * f_{X_{i_2}}(x) =&amp; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X_{i_1}}(z)
f_{X_{i_2}}(x - z) \ud z &#92;&#92;

<p>Using the same technique, one can prove the claim by induction.
What’s written above is the base case.</p>

    <id>http://vincenttam.github.io/blog/2015/02/28/saw-a-new-type-of-ring</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday evening, I saw a <strong>local ring</strong> in a commutative ring
with unity for the first time.  At the first glance, I <em>didn’t</em> know
how to make use of it’s definition — a ring that has only one
maximal ideal — to answer a question.  If I was given a local ring
$R$, then should I first assume that there’s a maximal ideal $M$, and
then construct another proper ideal $I$ of $R$ so that no proper
ideals of $R$ contained $I$ except for $I$ itself?  I got stuck at
this point for almost an hour, and <em>couldn’t</em> write down something
more for that question.</p>

<p>I finally read another half of the question, and understood the
statement of the whole question.  It would be impossible for me to do
the question <em>without</em> knowing the proper ideal that consisted merely
of elements of R which <em>don’t</em> have a multiplicative inverse.</p>

<p>After I had proved the statement in that question, I was still not
sure whether such a ring <em>exists</em>.  I <em>couldn’t</em> give an example of a
local ring.  This evening, I found it in Wikipedia, and realised that
even though I had already convinced myself that a finite field $F$ of
prime characteristic $p$ has an algebraic closure <span class="myeqn">$\displaystyle \overline{F} = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty
\fields_{p^i}$</span>, I still <em>didn’t</em> know many properties of the
structure of fields.<sup id="fnref:alg_closure"><a href="#fn:alg_closure" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  The simplest example of a local
ring is a field, which has only the trivial ideal <span class="myeqn">$\{0\}$</span> as its proper ideal.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this Chinese New Year holiday, I read E. Artin’s proof of the
existence of algebraic closure, which could be found online.<sup id="fnref:milne"><a href="#fn:milne" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Two days ago, I was stuck at the point where the ideal $I$ of
$F[\dots,X_f,\dots]$ was defined.  I <em>mistakenly</em> thought that one
needed to fix an arbitrary polynomial $f$ in the polynomial ring
$F[X]$ first because the goal of this theorem is to show the
existence of an algebraic field extension $E$ of $F$ so that $E$ is
algebraically closed, and for any nonconstant polynomial $f$ in
$F[X]$, $f$ has a root (a.k.a. zero) in $E$.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

<p>This noon, I finally saw “indexed by $f$”, and I found I should
interpret “the ideal generated by $f(X_f)$” in this way:</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
I := \left\{\sum_{m = 1}^n g_m (\dots,X_f,\dots) f_m (X_{f_m}) : n \in
\integers_{&gt;0}, f_i \in F[X], g_i (\dots,X_f,\dots) \forall i \in
\{1,\dots,n\}\right\},
\]
</div>

<p>instead of viewing $f(X)$ as a <em>fixed</em> polynomial in $F[X]$.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just read a statement which asserts that a subring isomorphic to
$\integers$ or $\integers_n$ can be found in any ring $R$ with unity.
The proof which is based on a ring homomorphism $\phi:\integers\to R$
defined by $\phi(m)=m\cdot 1$ <em>isn’t</em> difficult to read.</p>

<p>I used fifteen minutes to think of why one needs a <em>subring</em> inside
the ring $R$ with unity, instead of $R$.  After I’ve come up with
<span class="myeqn">$R=\langle1,\frac{1}{2}\rangle=\left\{\frac{a}{2^b}\mid a
\in \integers, b \in\integers_{\ge 0} \right\}$</span>, I start this
