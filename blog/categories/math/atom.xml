      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I tried <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1635782/290189">this Mathematics Stack Exchange question</a> by
drawing a Venn Diagram.</p>

<picture class="fancybox" title="A 4-set Venn Diagram">

</picture>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>A downvote was quickly casted on my answer below which a comment about
the non-existence of a Venn diagram with 4 sets was left.  I clicked
on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/825984/290189">the link to another question</a> in that comment to
understand why I got this downvote: <strong>Why a 4-set Venn diagram
<em>doesn’t</em> exist?</strong></p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>I understood the arguments of Joebot’s answer up to the “application
of binomial theorem”, but I <em>didn’t</em> understand the Euler’s formular.
In fact, for any 3-D object with edges, vertices and faces, one can
represent it by a 2-D planar graph, on which the outermost region also
represents one of the faces of the 3-D object.  Thus, the Euler’s
formula for any 3-D object can be seen on a 2-D planar graph.  I’m
amazed that this can be proved by mathematical induction on the number
of regions on the 2-D graph (which corresponds to that of faces of the
3-D object).  IMHO, this should be taught in high schools as examples
of mathematical induction, instead of divisibility of integers, which
can be done better using modular arithmetic.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>To prove a limit, we need to find a number before.  The definition
gives us <em>no</em> hints on how to find it.  Cauchy’s Criterion for
convergence is a good method for finding it numerically in “certain
spaces” (e.g. $\R,L^p,L^\infty$) because the definition is
<em>intrinsic</em>.</p>

<p>Unluckily, there’re some “strange spaces” where Cauchy’s Criterion
<em>isn’t</em> enough to give a convergence.  The simplest one is $\Q$
equipped with the usual metric in $\R$.</p>

<p><span class="myeqn">
One knows that an incomplete metric space $X$ can extended to form a
complete one $X^*$ (which is unique up to isometric isomorphism) so
that $\iota(X)$ is dense in $X^*$.  That is, $\overline{\iota(X)} =
X^*$.
</span></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>I confused $\overline{X}$ with $X^*$.  In other words, what’s the
difference between the completion of $X$ and the closure of $X$?</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<h3 id="general-answer">General answer</h3>

<p>To see this, we note that the closedness of a set is discussed
<em>relative to another set</em>, so if one stays inside the incomplete space
$X$, then one notices that <strong>$X$ is closed in $X$</strong>.  However, even
though one <em>doesn’t</em> know about $X^*$, one still realises that $X$ is
incomplete.</p>

<p>If one becomes wiser and seeks to “complete a given Cauchy sequence”
(i.e. find a limit for a Cauchy sequence in $X$), it’s <em>impossible to
live inside $X$</em>—one needs to escape from $X$ to $X^*$ so as to
enjoy more freedom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claim: $X$ <em>isn’t</em> closed in $X^*$.</p>

  <p>Approach: We <em>won’t</em> start from the topological definition (open
complement).  Instead, we’ll argue with sequences.</p>

  <p>Proof: Since $X$ is <em>incomplete</em>, there exists a Cauchy sequence
$(x_n)$ in $X$ so that it has <em>no</em> limit in $X$.  The completeness
of $X^*$ is applied to construct a limit $x$ in $X^*$.  If one
allows $X$ to be closed, then $x$ will stay inside $X$, which
contradicts the fact that $(x_n)$ has <em>no</em> limit in $X$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though living in $X$ is sad, and it seems to be hard to escape
(because $X$ is closed in $X$), if one has a chance to travel outside,
one will see that $X$ is <em>not</em> really closed—it is possible to find
a sequence $(x_n)$ to escape from $X$.</p>

<h3 id="specific-example">Specific example</h3>

<p>$\Q$ is closed in $\Q$, but it <em>isn’t</em> closed in $\R$.  Therefore, the
concept of closedness depends on the bigger space.  However, the
concept of completeness only depends on $\Q$ itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">Mathematics Stack Exchange</a> use <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to
  typeset math expressions.</li>
  <li>I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">GNU Octave</a> to efficiently perform (matrix)
  calculations for a quick and correct response on Mathematics Stack
  Exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Recently, I encountered a <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1614115/290189">linear algebra problem</a> on
Mathematics Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>For any given matrix $A$ in Octave,</p>

<pre class="cliUB"><code>A = [1 2 2; 2 3 4; 4 4 2]
A =

   1   2   2
   2   3   4
   4   4   2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>how can one generate its $\rm \LaTeX$ code</strong></p>

<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>$\rm \LaTeX$ code for matrix $A$ </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>A = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;2\ 2&amp;3&amp;4\ 4&amp;4&amp;2 \end{bmatrix}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>so that one gets</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;2\\ 2&amp;3&amp;4\\ 4&amp;4&amp;2 \end{bmatrix}?
\]
</div>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I searched “octave to latex matrices” and I found <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/43733">this answer</a>
quite useful.  I issued the first command to see the result.</p>

<pre class="cliUB"><code>strrep(strrep(mat2str(A),",","&amp;"),";","\\\\\n")(2:end-1)
ans = 1 2 2\\
2 3 4\\
4 4 2
</code></pre>

<p>I suspected that it <em>didn’t</em> work.  I posted it as a comment and
verified that I was right.  To fix this, I extracted the function
<code>mat2str(A)</code> in the middle of this command to see the results.  From
its result (<code>ans = [1 2 2;2 3 4;4 4 2]</code>), I realised that <code>strrep</code>
standed for “string replace”.  Then, I changed the double-quoted comma
in the second argument of function <code>strrep</code> to a double-quoted
whitespace character, and got the anticipated result.</p>

<pre class="cliUB"><code>strcat("\\begin{bmatrix}\n",strrep(strrep(mat2str(A)," ","&amp;"), ...
";","\\\\\n")(2:end-1),"\n\\end{bmatrix}\n")
ans = \begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;2\\
2&amp;3&amp;4\\
4&amp;4&amp;2
\end{bmatrix}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="inadequacies">Inadequacies</h2>

<p>I <em>don’t</em> know how to do this for matrices with fractions.  I think I
can work it out by searching and testing in several hours, but I
<em>don’t</em> have the time to do so.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h2>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<p>I revised some definitions in linear algebra.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A matrix $U$ is <strong>unitary</strong> iff $UU^\star = U^\star U = I$.</li>
  <li>A matrix $N$ is <strong>normal</strong> iff $NN^\star = N^\star N$.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gnu-octave">GNU Octave</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The function <code>strrep(str,"foo","bar")</code> replaces all instances of
  <code>foo</code> in <code>str</code> with <code>bar</code>.  It can be used in a nested manner for
  multiple replacements.</li>
  <li>The function <code>strcat(str1,str2,...)</code> concatenates the strings
  inside.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grep">Grep</h3>

<p>When I was writing this article, I wanted to search for “<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">octave</a>”
(with the square brackets “[]”) with <code>grep</code> inside <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, but I got
over 1270 results.  I tried adding single/double quotes and escaping
the square brackets with a backslash, but I faied again.  Finally, I
googled “grep escape character” for a solution.  Since then, I know
that I should <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12387802/3184351">add the <code>-F</code> flag to <code>grep</code></a> to fix the
string.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two days ago, I read a proof about a basic property of open sets in
Royden’s <em>Real Analysis</em>.  It says that each open set in $\Bbb R$ is a
countable union of disjoint open intervals.  Reading the book, I got
stuck at the countability.  I tried to think of a map between each
open interval and a rational number, but I <em>didn’t</em> know <em>which one to
choose</em>.  It took me half an hour to understand from the words that
the <em>one single</em> rational number inside the open interval can be
arbitrarily chosen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was puzzled at $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ for a
while.  On the LHS, I came up with “arbitrary union”; on the RHS, I
thought of “countable union”.  It seemed that “countable union” is
more restrictive than “arbitrarily union”.  My teacher said that this
is <em>by definition</em>, and I realized that I forgot the definition of
Borel sets.  He thought that I <em>didn’t</em> know $\mathcal{T}_\sigma =
\mathcal{T}$.  Finally, I get it.</p>
