To find a finite subcover of a countable open cover
$\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \N}$ of a $T_1$ space $X$ which has the
Bolzano–Weierstrass property, one has to pick a sequence in $X$ in
order to apply the Bolzano–Weierstrass property.  In order to build a
link between the sequence with the countable open cover, I picked a
point $x_n$ from each $U_n$, and then build an infinite set $A$
consisting of $x_n \forall n \in \N$.  I knew that $A$ is compact, but
what does that do with the countable open cover?
</span></p>

<p>Reading my notes again, I realised the trick of choosing $x_q$: it
<em>shouldn’t</em> be chosen from $U_k$ with index $k$ which is smaller than
<span class="myeqn">$n_q$.  In other words, $x_q \in
U_{n_q}$ and $x_q \notin U_k \forall k &lt; n_q$.  If we failed to make
such choices, that means we don't have enough $U_k$'s and $x_q$'s,
meaning that $X$ is the finite union of $U_k$'s and it's countably
compact.  Otherwise, we continue this process to get an infinite set
$A$ can be set up in the same way: $A := \left\{x_q \in X : q \in \N
\right\}$.</span>  One will see that $A$ has <em>no</em> cluster point,
contracdicting the Bolzano–Weierstrass property of $X$.</p>

<p><span class="myeqn">
Assume that $x \in X$.  $\exists m \in \N$ so that $x \in U_m$ and $x
\notin U_j \forall j &lt; m$.  I was puzzled at the line $n_N &lt; m \le
n_{N + 1}$.  Using the analogy of "queuing", I understood what's going
on.

<p><span class="myeqn">
Since $X$ is $T_1$, which is equivalent to the closeness of
singletons, deleting finitely many singletons from an open set won't
change the openness of the set.  We have a neighbourhood $V := U_m
\setminus \left\{x_j : j \le N \text{ and } x \ne x_j \right\}$ of $x$
which intersects $A$ at no more than one point.  Thus, there exists a
deleted neighbourhood $V \setminus \{x\}$ of $x$ so that $V \cap A
\setminus \{x\} = \varnothing$.  Hence, $\forall x \in X, x \notin
A'$.

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>To deduce that <a href="/blog/2015/09/28/normal-compact-t2-spaces/">compact $T_2$ spaces are $T_4$</a>,  I tried using
the arguments of the proof in the previous post, but I <em>couldn’t</em> do
it.  Therefore, I read another proof about the normality of regular
Lindelöf spaces instead.</p>

<h2 id="the-proof-at-first-glance">The proof at first glance</h2>

<p><span class="myeqn">
Suppose that $X$ is the given space, and $H$ and $K$ are the given
sets.  $\left\{G_n^* : n \in \omega\right\}$ and $\left\{W_n^* : n \in
\omega\right\}$ are open countable subcovers of $H$ and $K$
respectively.  On p.91 in Davis's Topology book, I saw the following
equations.
</span></p>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  U_0 &amp;= G_0^* &amp;\quad V_0 &amp;= W_0^* \setminus \overline{U_0} \\
  U_1 &amp;= G_1^* \setminus \overline{V_0} &amp;\quad V_1 &amp;= W_1^* \setminus
  (\overline{U_0} \cup \overline{U_1}) \\
  U_2 &amp;= G_2^* \setminus (\overline{V_0} \cup \overline{V_1}) &amp;\quad
  V_2 &amp;= W_2^* \setminus (\overline{U_0} \cup \overline{U_1} \cup
  \overline{U_2}) \\
  \vdots \\
  U_n &amp;= G_n^* \setminus \bigcup_{k &lt; n} \overline{V_k} &amp;\quad V_n &amp;=
  W_n^* \setminus \bigcup_{k \le n} \overline{U_k} \\
  U &amp;= \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty U_n &amp;\quad V &amp;= \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty
  V_n
\end{alignat*}
</div>

<p>I <em>didn’t</em> know what to do when I first saw these equalities.  It’s
<em>hard</em> to understand the reason of $U \cap V = \varnothing$ by just
reading the symbols.  Luckily, an analogy of climbing mounts is given.
Therefore, I finally understood how the open subsets $U_n$’s and
$V_n$’s are built step-by-step while preserving disjointness and
openness.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To show that any compact Hausdorff space is $T_4$, one may first show
that it’s $T_3$.  To see this, using set theory notations may be quite
<em>difficult</em>.  For mediocre students, the contents of the following
seciton may sound <em>unnatural</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-sketch-of-the-proof">A sketch of the proof</h2>

<p>Suppose that we want to separate a point $x \notin A$ and a closed set
$A$ in a compact $T_2$ space $X$ by two <em>disjoint</em> open sets $U$ and
$V$ so that $x \in U$ and $A \subseteq V$.  A standard proof is to
apply the $T_2$ property of $X$ to $x$ and each $y \in A$ so as to
yield two <em>disjoint</em> open sets <span class="myeqn">$U_y,V_y \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U_y$ and $y
\in V_y$</span>.  Since $A$ should be contained in an open set $V$, in
other words, an <em>open cover</em> of $A$ is needed, one might be tempted to
construct the following union of open sets.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{equation}
  V = \bigcup_{y \in A} V_y
  \label{Vinf}
\end{equation}
</div>

<p>However, one <em>can’t</em> ensure that the following <em>infinite</em> intersection
of open sets is open.</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{equation}
  U = \bigcap_{y \in A} U_y
  \label{Uinf}
\end{equation}
</div>

<p>For instance, by the Nested Interval Theorem,</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  \{0\} = \bigcap_{n \in \N} \left( -\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n} \right).
\]
</div>

<p>Thus, one applies the compactness of $X$ to get <em>finite</em> versions of
\eqref{Vinf} and \eqref{Uinf}.</p>

<h2 id="a-snapshot-of-this-fact">A snapshot of this fact</h2>

<p>Since it’s so <em>difficult</em> to remember every detail of the proof, I
love illustrating it using a picture.</p>

<p>How can a compact regular space be regular?  See my next post.</p>

says that <em>all</em> zeros of $P’(z)$ are inside a half plane in which all
zeros of $P(z)$ lie.</p>

<p>Ahlfors says that <q>a directed line $z = a + bt$ determines a right
half plane consisting of all points with $\Im(z - a) / b &lt; 0$…</q>
(see Chap. 1, Sec. 2.3)<sup id="fnref:ahlfors"><a href="#fn:ahlfors" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  After drawing the figure for the 
drawing the figure for $z = -(1 + i)t$, I realized that I should pay
attention to the word “directed” and interpret “right” as “to the
right of the vector $b$ drawn on the line $z = a + bt$”.</p>

<p>The following equation puzzled me for a while.  (see Chap. 2, Sec.
1.3)<sup id="fnref:ibid"><a href="#fn:ibid" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<div class="myeqn">
\begin{equation}
  \Im\left( \frac{z - \alpha_k}{b} \right) = \Im\left( \frac{z - a}{b}
  \right) - \Im\left( \frac{\alpha_k - a}{b} \right) &gt; 0
  \label{stuck}
\end{equation}
</div>

<p>I tried sketching a diagram to understand what’s going on, but this
<em>isn’t</em> so helpful.  In fact, the above equation starts from
<span class="myeqn">$z - \alpha_k = (z - a) - (\alpha_k -
a)$</span>.</p>

<p><span class="myeqn">
The whole proof makes use of a half plane $H := \{z \in \C \mid \Im[(z
- a) / b] &lt; 0\}$ in which all zeros $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ of
$P(z)$ lie, and it follows the logic of proof by contradiction: each
$\alpha_k$ is assumed to be in $H$ while $z$ isn't.  It ends with the
conclusion that $\Im(b P'(z) / P(z)) &lt; 0$ by \eqref{stuck} and the
equation
</span></p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  \frac{P'(z)}{P(z)} = \sum_{k = 1}^n \Im\left( \frac{1}{z - \alpha_k}
  \right).
\]
</div>

<p>Finally, I saw a corollary of this theorem: all zeros of $P’(z)$ are
inside the smallest convex polygon in which all zeros of $P(z)$ lie.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many math books that I’ve read referred me to other books for the
proof of the equivalence of the Axiom of Choice and Zorn’s Lemma.
This afternoon, I spent more than two hours to understand the proof
that the later implies and former in <cite>Topology</cite> written by
Davis.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up a non-empty partially ordered set $(\mathcal{P},\le)$</li>
  <li>Let $\mathcal{T}$ be any non-empty chain in $\mathcal{P}$.</li>
  <li>Prove that $\cup \mathcal{T} \in \mathcal{P}$.</li>
  <li>Apply Zorn’s Lemma to get a maximal element $g \in \mathcal{P}$.</li>
  <li><span class="myeqn">Use the maximality of $g$ to claim
that the domain of $g$ equals the family of non-empty subsets
$(S_i)_{i \in I}$ from which elements $(x_i)_{i \in I}$ are chosen.
</span></li>
</ol>

<p>In the book, $\le$ means function extension, and</p>

<div class="myeqn">
\[
  \mathcal{P} = \{f: f \text{ is a function, } dom\,f \subseteq
  (S_i)_{i \in I}, f(x) \in x \forall x \in dom\,f\}.
\]
</div>

<p><span class="myeqn">
Step (3) is proved step-by-step according to the definition of
$\mathcal{P}$.  Usually, suppose that $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2) \in f$,
$x_1 = x_2 \implies y_1 = y_2$.  The book uses the contrapositive form
of this statement.  I was stuck at the sentence <q>Now, for a set to
be an element of $dom\cup\mathcal{T}$, it must be an element of some
member of $\mathcal{T}$</q>.  At first, I omitted the phrase "some
member of", and stopped for half an hour.  Reading the next sentence
<q>Hence $dom\cup\mathcal{T} \subseteq (S_i)_{i \in I}$</q>, I knew
how to interpret the sentence where I was stuck: if $S \in
dom\cup\mathcal{T}$, $\exists f \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $S \in
dom\,f$.  Since $f \in \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}$, $dom\,f
\subseteq (S_i)_{i \in I}$.  Then $S \in (S_i)_{i \in I}$, and thus
$dom\cup\mathcal{T} \subseteq (S_i)_{i \in I}$.
