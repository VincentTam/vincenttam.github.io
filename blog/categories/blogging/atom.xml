      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://konklone.com/post/github-pages-now-sorta-supports-https-so-use-it">GitHub Pages now supports HTTPS</a>.</li>
  <li>I saw that Google search showed the HTTP version of the hyperlinks.</li>
  <li>I want to convert add the existing “http://” to “https://”.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I changed “http://…” to “https://…” in the Admin settings for
the disqus site of this blog.</li>
  <li>The original comments <em>disappeared</em>!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How can I get back the original comments and correct the URLs of the
links to my blog articles on Disqus?</strong></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="failed-attempt">Failed attempt</h2>

<p>I tried to use the “Domain Migration Wizard”.  <em>Lacking</em> knowledge in
terms like “host”, I just clicked the button to proceed even though I
saw that the original host name was recognised as “http://https://.”.</p>

<p>In the end, I messed up the URLs of the forum threads.  After using
the “Wizard”, I waited for about 20 hours, and then I saw that
hundreds of links started with
“http://https://vincentam.githhub.io/…”.</p>

<p>I read a lot of articles from the Web, but the problem that they’re
facing <em>weren’t</em> the same as mine.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I finally decided to use the “URL Mapper”.  When I read the official
onine help page about this migration tool, I realised that I should
give it a try.  The moment that I opened the generated CSV file in a
spreadsheet program, I knew that I had chosen the right way because
this gave me more control over the URL of the posts on my blog.</p>

<p>I also added a script copied from <a href="https://gist.github.com/konklone/9968713">konklone’s Gist</a> for using
HTTPS by defalut.</p>

<p>In the official documentation, a spreadsheet program is used to modify
CSV files.  In fact, if one knows regular expression, one would do
batch text editing using some tools available in the CLI.  For
instance, I used Vim to do this last night.</p>

<p>This morning, I discovered that the URLs in the box “Promoted
Discovery” were <em>still</em> wrong!  This afternoon, I read a lot of
related websites, just like what I did yesterday.  I <em>wasn’t</em> sure
what to do next.  The URLs shown in the “Admin” page were finally
correct, but those hyperlinks on the pages “View in discussion” on the
white-backgrounded Disqus site <em>weren’t</em>.</p>

<p>Then I worked on something else, and at about 8pm tonight, all the
URLs have finally been corrected.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h2>

<p>I need to be patient and work on other things first after I’ve already
tried all possible ways to solve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>

<p>During the site migration, one <em>couldn’t</em> see the comments and the
“Also on” box took one to <em>wrong</em> pages.  I apologize for any
inconvenience caused.</p>

  <li>Blogs
    <ul>
      <li>Accessible anywhere anytime, as long as an Internet connection is
 available.</li>
      <li>Multiple concurrent users: it can be viewed by <em>multiple</em>
 readers at the <em>same</em> time.</li>
      <li>Perfectly reproduced: contents of the blog can be copied into
 the computer.</li>
      <li>Searching: readers can find information useful for them quickly.</li>
      <li>Characters can usually be neatly displayed, despite the author’s
 poor handwriting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Paper notebooks
    <ul>
      <li>Subject to aging: oxidized pages will become yellow; ink will
 fade out.</li>
      <li>Easily damaged: pages are easily torn if the owner doesn’t take
 care of the notebook.</li>
      <li>Difficult for sharing: unless you take a photo of it and share
 it on the Internet, others can’t view the notebook while
 you’re using it.</li>
      <li>Inconvenient and inefficient to locate information: readers need
 to turn over the pages and skim through them to find the
 useful parts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="privacy-of-the-shared-contents">Privacy of the shared contents</h2>

<p>Once something is uploaded to the Internet, it is likely that <strong>the
uploaded contents can <em>never</em> be deleted</strong> because</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s <em>not always possible to delete the uploaded resources in the
  server</em>; and</li>
  <li>there’s <em>no absoulutely legitamate way to delete the backups of the
  uploaded resources</em> at other locations where you have <em>no</em> access
  rights, for example, others’ computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, there’s <em>no absoulute privacy</em> for contents uploaded to the
Internet.  They’re expected to (be exposed to the) <em>public</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="usages-of-blogs">Usages of blogs</h2>

<p>They can be used to write something that</p>

<ul>
  <li>you want to share; and</li>
  <li>you don’t mind to share—it won’t be part of your private
  information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowledge and universal facts are typical examples of impersonal
information.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This noon, I received some pingback notifications.  It is possible
that I get these messages because I included some hyperlinks that link
back to my own posts.  After viewing the contents, I found them
meaningless and wanted to delete them.  Harrison provides the reasons
for <em>not</em> allowing pingbacks.<sup id="fnref:src"><a href="#fn:src" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As the author has said, he will simply delete the pingbacks on his
blog pages.  Moreover, I <em>don’t</em> want to bother the authors of posts
to which I has linked.  Therefore, I’ve found the last part of the
official support page useful.<sup id="fnref:doc"><a href="#fn:doc" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="disabling-pingbacks">Disabling Pingbacks</h3>

  <p>You can easily disable pingbacks on individual posts via the
Discussion module on your Add New or Edit Post page:<br />

I’ve found. I’ve tried this plugin but it <em>doesn’t</em> work for my

authors’ last Blogger post, which was, ironically, about <em>his switch
