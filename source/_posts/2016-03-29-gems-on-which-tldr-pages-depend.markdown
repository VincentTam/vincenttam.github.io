Tonight, I've installed [TLDR pages][tldr] by typing `gem install
tldrb` since I *don't* have `npm` installed.

Here's a list of gems actually fetched.

1. `bales-0.1.2`
2. `unf-0.2.0.beta2`
3. `domain_name-0.5.20160310`
4. `http-cookie-1.0.2`
5. `mime-types-2.99.1`
6. `netrc-0.11.0`
7. `rest-client-1.8.0`
8. `tldrb-0.0.2`
