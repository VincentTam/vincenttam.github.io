To use [Vim] in other computers, the official website of PortableApps
has already provided users [a satisfactory solution][sol].  The
installation size is about 28Â MB (according to the released figure).
If you *won't* have it installed in a portable device and *don't* want
to download and install it into a new machine each time, maybe you can
try [Vim.js].  However, I've found it *slow*, when compared to a [Vim]
program.
