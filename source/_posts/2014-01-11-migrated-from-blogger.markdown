I tried finding a way to blog using Vim, and `blogger.vim` is what
I've found. I've tried this plugin but it *doesn't* work for my
computer. *Without* Vim, writing code is *painful* for me. Read the
authors' last Blogger post, which was, ironically, about *his switch
to WordPress*, I followed his footstep.[^1]

Note: For posts about online syntax highlighting and Mathjax on
Blogger, they *won't* make sense here, so refer to
[my original blog][orig_blog] if necessary.
