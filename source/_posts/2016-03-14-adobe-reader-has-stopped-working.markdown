Problem
---

I opened Adobe Reader on a M\$ Win\* 7 desktop in a library so as to
print a PDF file.  I *couldn't* understand why this window kept
popping up.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Adobe RdrCEF has stopped working">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/AdbRdr/RdrCEF.png"
    media="(min-width: 525px)"></source> 
  <img alt="Adobe RdrCEF has stopped working" width="300"
    src="/images/posts/AdbRdr/RdrCEF.png" />
</picture>

Result
---

Lacking time, I *won't* find a solution for this problem.

If I choose to ignore this window, then the printing job can still be
carried out.  Therefore, I just waited until the document was printed.
Then I closed Adobe Reader.

Remarks
---

I choose Sumatra PDF since it is licensed under GPL.
