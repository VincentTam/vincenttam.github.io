<p>This morning, I've found a Firefox Add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer/">Markdown Viewer</a>. As its name suggests, it's a Firefox plugin that enables users to view Markdown documents. The screenshot provided on the home page of the add-on illustrates that it works on M$ Win*. How about GNU/Linux? I clicked the button and installed the plugin. After that, I used <code>:restart</code> in Vimperator to see what happened if I used Firefox to view a local Markdown file with extension name <code>.md</code>.</p>

<p>It turned out that nothing happened! With Lai's review titled <em>Work on Linux</em>, I figured out what to do. After looking at his suggested code for <code>vi ~/.mozilla/firefox/*default/mimeTypes.rdf</code>, I really tested it and it worked. Critical readers will then ask about the way to include multiple file extensions.</p>

<p>Browsing the code with <code>#</code> in the RDF file helps. Here's what my results.</p>

{% codeblock lang:xml %}
<RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:mimetype:application/vnd.ms-excel"
NC:value="application/vnd.ms-excel"
NC:editable="true"
NC:description="Microsoft Excel Worksheet">
<NC:fileExtensions>xls</NC:fileExtensions>
<NC:fileExtensions>xlb</NC:fileExtensions>
<NC:fileExtensions>xlt</NC:fileExtensions>
<NC:handlerProp RDF:resource="urn:mimetype:handler:application/vnd.ms-excel"/>
</RDF:Description>
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>According to <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files">a question on Super User</a>, we use <em>more than one</em> extension name for a Markdown file. However, a GNU/Linux user should <strong>never</strong> use <code>.md</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, combining Lai's and Cas' posts, I've come up with <a href="https://gist.github.com/VincentTam/8800268">a Gist.</a></p>
