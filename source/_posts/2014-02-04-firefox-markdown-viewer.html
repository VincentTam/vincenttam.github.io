<p>This morning, I've found a Firefox Add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer/">Markdown Viewer</a>. As its name suggests, it's a Firefox plugin that enables users to view Markdown documents. The screenshot provided on the home page of the add-on illustrates that it works on M$ Win*. How about GNU/Linux? I clicked the button and installed the plugin. After that, I used <code>:restart</code> in Vimperator to see what happened if I used Firefox to view a local Markdown file with extension name <code>.md</code>.</p>

<p>It turned out that nothing happened! With Lai's review titled <em>Work on Linux</em>, I figured out what to do. After looking at his suggested code for <code>vi ~/.mozilla/firefox/*default/mimeTypes.rdf</code>, I really tested it and it worked. Critical readers will then ask about the way to include multiple file extensions.</p>

<p>Browsing the code with <code>#</code> in the RDF file helps. Here's what my results.<br />
[code firstline="123" highlight="5,6,7" language="xml"]<br />
&lt;RDF:Description RDF:about=&quot;urn:mimetype:application/vnd.ms-excel&quot;<br />
                 NC:value=&quot;application/vnd.ms-excel&quot;<br />
                 NC:editable=&quot;true&quot;<br />
                 NC:description=&quot;Microsoft Excel Worksheet&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;NC:fileExtensions&gt;xls&lt;/NC:fileExtensions&gt;<br />
  &lt;NC:fileExtensions&gt;xlb&lt;/NC:fileExtensions&gt;<br />
  &lt;NC:fileExtensions&gt;xlt&lt;/NC:fileExtensions&gt;<br />
  &lt;NC:handlerProp RDF:resource=&quot;urn:mimetype:handler:application/vnd.ms-excel&quot;/&gt;<br />
&lt;/RDF:Description&gt;<br />

<p>According to <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files">a question on Super User</a>, we use <em>more than one</em> extension name for a Markdown file. However, a GNU/Linux user should <strong>never</strong> use <code>.md</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, combining Lai's and Cas' posts, I've come up with the following Gist.</p>
