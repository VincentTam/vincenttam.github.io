I've just read a statement which asserts that a subring isomorphic to
$\Z$ or $\Z_n$ can be found in any ring $R$ with unity.  The proof
which is based on a ring homomorphism $\phi:\Z\to R$ defined by
$\phi(m) = m\cdot 1$ *isn't* difficult to read.

I used fifteen minutes to think of why one needs a *subring* inside
the ring $R$ with unity, instead of $R$.  After I've come up with
<span class="myeqn"
markdown="0">$R=\langle1,\frac{1}{2}\rangle=\left\{\frac{a}{2^b}
\,\middle|\, a \in \Z, b \in\Z_{\ge 0} \right\}$</span>, I start this
post.
