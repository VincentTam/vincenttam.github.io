I've just read a statement which asserts that a subring isomorphic to
$\integers$ or $\integers_n$ can be found in any ring $R$ with unity.
The proof which is based on a ring homomorphism $\phi:\integers\to R$
defined by $\phi(m)=m\cdot 1$ *isn't* difficult to read.

I used fifteen minutes to think of why one needs a *subring* inside
the ring $R$ with unity, instead of $R$.  After I've come up with
$R=\langle1,\frac{1}{2}\rangle=\left\\{\frac{a}{2^b}\mid a \in
\integers, b \in\integers\_{\ge 0} \right\\}$, I start this post.
