<p><a href="https://gist.github.com" title="Gist">Gist</a> enables computer users to post their source code online. Since Gist is a <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> repository, they can view each change to the code.</p>

<p>However, it is inconvenient to use the online editor in the homepage of Gist, especially for geeks. For example, a programmer believes that <a href="http://aknow-work.blogspot.hk/2013/04/programmer-code-gist-vim.html" title="[Aknow::Work]">it's <em>not</em> good to manually type or paste the code onto Gist</a>. I directly quote Aknow::Work's words here.</p>

<blockquote>
    但是阿，如果你是手動把 code 弄到 gist 上面，那這樣就太遜了，基本上各大編輯器都有跟 gist 互動的 plugin，如果你用 Vim，可以使用 gist-vim，可以讓你直接在 Vim 裡生成、編輯、讀取 gist，完成後還可以幫你把連結開起來。

<p>This can be explained in this way: it's unproductive to use a mouse for text editing. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1088387/what-specific-productivity-gains-do-vim-emacs-provide-over-gui-text-editors" title="Vim vs Mouse">A relevant question on Stack Overflow</a> was answered by many users. Mark Rushakoff finds Vim's keyboard commands <em>"almost priceless"</em> since your fingers don't have to leave the keyboard and grab the mouse. Jeremy Smyth describes this as the "biggest gain" of using Vim or Emacs.</p>

<p>As suggested by Aknow::Work's words above, we can use <a href="https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim" title="Gist.vim">Gist.vim</a> so that we can make use of the advantages of Vim while writing code, and post the code onto <a href="https://gist.github.com" title="Gist">Gist</a> quickly.</p>

<p>Except the official <code>README.mkd</code>, there's <a href="http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3931076/Get-More-Out-of-Git-Use-Gist-With-Vim.htm" title="Gist Tutorial">a tutorial on ServerWatch</a> for <a href="https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim" title="Gist.vim">Gist.vim</a> newbies. This article shortens the time needed to find the useful command <code>Gist -l</code>.</p>
