<p>This noon, I received some pingback notifications. It is possible that I get these messages because I included some hyperlinks that link back to my own posts. After viewing the contents, I found them meaningless and wanted to delete them. Harrison provides the reasons for <em>not</em> allowing pingbacks.<sup id="fnref-524-1"><a href="#fn-524-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As the author has said, he will simply delete the pingbacks on his blog pages. Moreover, I <em>don't</em> want to bother the authors of posts to which I has linked. Therefore, I've found the last part of the official support page useful.<sup id="fnref-524-2"><a href="#fn-524-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  <h3>Disabling Pingbacks</h3>
  <br />
  You can easily disable pingbacks on individual posts via the Discussion module on your Add New or Edit Post page:<br />
