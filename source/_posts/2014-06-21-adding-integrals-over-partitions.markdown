In the error list of FitzPatrick's *Advanced Calculus*, it's said that
on p. 479, ln. 14â€“21, "it doesn't seem that $\vect{P}\_k$ can be
chosen as indicated..."  I spent some time to understand what
$\vect{P}^\*\_k$ was.

It took me an hour to see what's wrong with $\vect{P}\_k$.  It's
*much* easier to understand the words using figures.

What the $\vect{J}$'s are?

Suppose $\vect{I} \equiv [0,2] \times [0,2]$.

$\vect{J}$ is any of the small rectangles in the above figure inside
$\vect{I}$.

$\vect{P}\_k (\vect{J})$ is a partition of $\vect{J}$.  In other
words, $\vect{P}\_k (\vect{J})$ contains a small black solid square
and the gray dashed lines inside the square.

The above figure *can't* be a partition of $\vect{I}$.

$\vect{P}^\*\_k (\vect{J})$ is a refinement of $\vect{J}$.
