I've found [a useful page](http://wiki.hotoo.me/Vim.html) introducing
a Vim lover.  It consists of plenty of links to many useful resources.
Unfortunately, for Vim users who *can't* understand Chinese, I'm not
sure if they can understand the contents of the page.  I hope Google
Translation can help.  Otherwise, they can also find some hyperlinks
which take them to other English websites.
