I've found [a useful page][src] introducing a Vim lover.  It consists
of plenty of links to many useful resources.  Unfortunately, for Vim
users who *can't* understand Chinese, I'm not sure if they can
understand the contents of the page.  I hope Google Translation can
help.  Otherwise, they can also find some hyperlinks which take them
to other English websites.
