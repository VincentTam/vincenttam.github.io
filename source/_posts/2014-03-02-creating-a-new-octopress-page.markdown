I haven't learnt something about Octopress for 2 weeks.  I hope that I
can create a GitHub project page using Octopress successfully.

I have seen a comment for a blog post which briefly describes the
procedures for making `gh-pages`.  The user who has left the comment
claims that the posts, which should be under the `source/_posts`
directory[^doc], is in the `source` branch of Octopress Git
repository.  I'm going to figure it out.  No matter it's true or not,
it's something that puzzles some Octopress users.

Creating an ABOUT page

I couldn't find the answer for adding new items to the navigation bar
at the top of the posts and under the header in an Octopress blog
because I didn't know the Google search words.  This afternoon, I
found that googling "octopress page navigation" help.  I managed to
find a blog post on that.[^octopress_about]
