Objective
---

To set up a printer-friendly framework for blog posts/pages.

Background
---

Two months ago, in order to install [Clapper's image popup plugin][imgpopup] in this blog[^1], I studied [the source code of his blog on GitHub][BrizzledSrc].  In this process, I learnt the roles of `/sass\/(custom\/_)?(screen|print).scss/`.  (To be concise, I write a [Perl] regex.)  Lacking time to learn CSS, I just directly copied Clapper's CSS settings for printing.

Problems on the printed page
---

1. Missing author and date
2. Screenshots were too large and part of them flowed out of the page.

Solution

### Display author and dates

Using [Firefox]'s "**Inspect Element**" and searching the generated HTML code for a post, I discovered that those missing parts belonged to `<pre class="meta">` tags.  In Clapper's `sass/custom/_print.scss`, he *didn't* display them.  Before the removal of the section of CSS code that hid the author and date, I input ".meta" in the search box above the panel that showed the HTML code of the current document.

{% img fancybox /images/posts/PrintScss/SearchCode.png 'Using Firefox's Style Inspector to search code' 'fig1' %}

I *don't* want the links for previous and next posts to appear in the printed version of a post in this blog, so I inspected the HTML code for those two links, and saw that only those two links belonged to an `<a class="base-alignment ...">` tag.  Therefore, I change `p.meta` to `a.base-alignment` in `sass/custom/_print.scss`.[^2]

### Scaling down the screenshots

After I wrote the HTML and CSS code of an HTML5 slide used for a presentation, I knew something about the `max-width` property in CSS.

Google searches:

| keep aspect ratio                            | [7][R5]           | I knew what to do from the first two answers.                      |
