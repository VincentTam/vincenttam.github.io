Background
---

This Sunday, I tried to do something similar to what I did in
May---install Octopresss on Windows 7.[^1]  Different from last time,
I used Ruby 2.0.0, the newest version of RubyInstaller for Windows
that I could find.[^2]

I could use Octopress with Ruby 1.9.3, so I expected that I could
easily deploy things with Ruby 2.0.0.  However, I was mistaken.

Solution
---

I used the relevant part of the error message to search for websites
describing similar/related problems.  Luckily, I found one in *Eaten
by Grues*.[^3]

I manually created a batch file in the *same* folder of
`python.exe`.[^4]

{% codeblock lang:bat python2.bat %}
@ECHO OFF
python %*
{% endcodeblock %}

The raison d'être of the trailing `%*` is explained in
[one of my old posts][pp2].

Finally, the section `which: no python2 in (...)` *disappeard* after I
locally generated the site again.

    See [Using Octopress on Another Device][pp1] in *Blog 1* for
    details.

[^2]:
    "Downloads" in the official website of RubyInstaller for Windows.
    ([URL][ruby4win])

[^3]:
    See [Installing PortableJekyll][sol] in *Eaten by Grues* for
    details.

[^4]: I suppose that Python is in the `PATH` variable.
