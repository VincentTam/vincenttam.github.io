<p>I tried finding a way to blog using Vim, and <code>blogger.vim</code> is what I've found. I've tried this plugin but it <em>doesn't</em> work for my computer. <em>Without</em> Vim, writing code is <em>painful</em> for me. Read the authors' last Blogger post, which was, ironically, about <em>his switch to WordPress</em>, I followed his footstep. Note: For posts about online syntax highlighting and Mathjax on Blogger, they <em>won't</em> make sense here, so refer to <a href="http://blogue-un.blogspot.hk/">my original blog</a> if necessary.</p>
