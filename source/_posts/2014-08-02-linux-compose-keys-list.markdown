While writing a post on Ubuntu, I forgot how to type an en-dash `–`
using Linux compose key.  It would be quite inefficient if I use the
corresponding Vim's digraph `<C-k>-n`.  Therefore, I tried to search
for a Linux compose key list.  However, both [Wikipedia] and [Ubuntu
Community Help Wiki][UbuntuHelp] points to a non-existent list at
http://hermit.org/Linux/ComposeKeys.html

Luckily, I remembered that I had viewed the desired list in Firefox a
long time ago.  As a result, I opened Firefox and typed "linux
compose" in the address bar.  Finally, I was able to access
[the list][topo] hosted on <http://www.topology.org>

If you're not willing to disclose whether you are a human or not[^1],
you may refer to [this one][fsymbols].
