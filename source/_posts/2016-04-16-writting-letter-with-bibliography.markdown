Background
---

Recently, I need to write letters.  Get the formatting for addressee
and sender automatically done, I choose $\rm \LaTeX$.  I cite a book
in my letter, and try to add a bibliography at the end of the letter.

Problem
---

During the compilation for the following letter, an error was thrown.

{% include_code A failed $\rm \LaTeX$ letter MaLettre/noltrbib.tex %}

{% include_code A sample Bib$\rm \LaTeX$ file MaLettre/noltrbib.bib %}

Here's my compilation procedure.

    $ xelatex noltrbib.tex
    $ biber noltrbib
    $ xelatex noltrbib.tex
    This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-0.9999.3 (TeX Live 2013/Debian)
     restricted \write18 enabled.
    ...
    ! Undefined control sequence.
    \\blx@head@bibliography [#1]->\section 
                                           *{#1}\markboth {\MakeUppercase {#1}}{...
    l.52 \end
             {letter}
    ?
    ...
{:.cliUB}

I type `<Enter>` at `?`, and get [a PDF that seems OK][pdf1].  You may
read the [log file for this file][log1] to know more about this error.
However, each time I use $\rm \LaTeX$-Suite to compile the document
inside Vim, a quickfix window pops up.  This is quite inconvenient: I
need to use `<C-w>k` to switch to the original buffer or `ZQ` to close
the quickfix window.  Therefore, I am motivated to find out a solution
for this error.

Solution

Luckily, I find the thread [*Environment thebibliography undefined
when using letter*][sol] in $\rm \LaTeX$ Forum extremely useful.  In
my opinion, if one can include inline code in a post in this forum,
the file name `letterbib.sty` and the command in the preamble can be
shown in monospaced font for readability.

{% include_code A minimal working $\rm \LaTeX$ letter MaLettre/ltrbib.tex %}

Finally, no compilation error is shown in the [generated log][log2].
You may view the [second generated PDF][pdf2].

Lessons learnt

To install the above STY file, which *isn't* found on CTAN, one needs
to manually download it to `~/texmf` on \*nix.  (Search "~/texmf" for
the way to find ["temxf" on Win\*][texmf-win].)  Searching "texmf
linux refresh", I find the way for a [$\rm \TeX$ database
update][texmf-update].  I miss the first argument in the command
`texhash ~/texmf`, and then the installed STY file *can't* be found in
`~/texmf/ls-R`.
