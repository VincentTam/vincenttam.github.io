Googling "tikz tutorial", one can find several useful PDF documents
which are easy to follow, such as the first two results.

1. [*PGF/TikZ - Graphics for* $\rm \LaTeX$ *---A tutorial*][tut1] by
Meik Hellmund
2. [*A very minimal introduction to TikZ*][tut2] by Jacques Crémer

The second PDF document covers plotting graphs in rectangular
coordinates.  **How about polar coordinates?**

It's easy to find a solution online, but understanding the code and
adapting them according to your needs are *much* harder.  One has to
make use of "cs", which stands for "coordinate system".  If one is too
lazy to read more webpages, then one may use the code below.

When I drew figures with [Ti*k*Z] a recent post on limits of composite
functions on $\R^n$, I found a way to construct random region with
Ti*k*Z in a $\rm \TeX$--$\rm \LaTeX$ Stack Exchange
question.[^rand_region]  This inspired me to come up with the
following graph.

Output
---

{% img center /images/posts/TikZPolar/graph.svg 750 'fig1' 'polar plot' %}

Source code
---

{% include_code The $\rm \LaTeX$ source code for the above graph lang:tex TikZPolar.tex %}

- I got the idea of for loop in TikZ from
    [*TikZ and PGF Manual*][man].
- I learnt the syntax for plotting functions from the PDF in item (2).
