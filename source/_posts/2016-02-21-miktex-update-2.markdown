Background
---

I need to write something in $\rm \LaTeX$.

Problem
---

I *can't* get any update by clicking "Update Mik$\rm \TeX$" in the
icon triggered by `miktex-portable.cmd`.  I faced the same problem as
[rantrave's][texse251242].

Discussion

If one urgently needs to get the updated version of a particular
package, one may directly download the LZMA file.[^pp1]  Actually, the
remote package repositories are still *online*.  I guess the problem
is in Mik$\rm \TeX$ update tool.  Anyways, I am still grateful for the
effort of its developers.

Resolution
---

The easiest way is to sit there and *wait for a day*.  Then the
problem will be *gone*.  It is possible that some difficulties occur,
but they can be overcome.

From [*Mik$\rm \LaTeX$ Update*][pp1], I know that only the "Update
Mik$\rm \TeX$" in the menu triggered by clicking the small icon will
work.  The update wizard inside the big window for the package manager
*won't*.

Sometimes, the chosen remote package repository can fail.  In this
case, just click the button and search for another one.

Lessons learnt

When there's nothing can be done, then one needs the mind of
non-action or non-being.
