Background
---

I've just written a linklog about ISS and GNU/Linux.[^pp]

Problem
---

I encountered a technical problem while creating the title of that
post.

Solution
---

The following picture illustrates what should be done: escape the ','
with '\\'.

[{% img /images/posts/OctPostTitle2/cmd.png  'title' 'MinGW command window' %}][fig_big]{:.fancybox}
