Background
---

I've just written a linklog about ISS and GNU/Linux.[^pp]

Problem
---

I encountered a technical problem while creating the title of that
post.

Solution
---

The following picture illustrates what should be done: escape the ','
with '\\'.

<picture class="fancybox" title="MinGW command window">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/OctPostTitle2/cmd-big.png" media="(min-width: 840px)"></source> 
  <source srcset="/images/posts/OctPostTitle2/cmd.png" media="(min-width: 620px)"></source> 
  <img alt="MinGW command window" src="/images/posts/OctPostTitle2/cmd-s.png" />
</picture>
