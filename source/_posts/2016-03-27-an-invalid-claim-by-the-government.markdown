I have viewed the Chinese version of the homepage of
[the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau][hp].  I clicked on the
validation icon for HTML 4.01 at the lower right-hand corner.

<picture class="fancybox" title="home page of gov webpage">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/W3CInvalid/cedb1.png"
    media="(min-width: 900px)"></source> 
  <img alt="home page of gov webpage" width="300"
    src="/images/posts/W3CInvalid/cedb1-300.png" />
</picture>

To my surprise, an error was produced.

<picture class="fancybox" title="W3C validator shows error">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/W3CInvalid/cedb2.png"
    media="(min-width: 900px)"></source> 
  <img alt="W3C validator shows error" width="300"
    src="/images/posts/W3CInvalid/cedb2-300.png" />
</picture>

Lacking time to write an email with good grammar to the authories, I
am waiting for someone to notice this error and I am looking forward
to seeing that this problem will be rectified.

To know more about the usage of the W3C validation icons, you may go
