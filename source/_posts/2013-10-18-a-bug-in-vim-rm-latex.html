<p>It's a small syntax error, and can be easily fixed with the addition of a space character. I found it from <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/vim-latex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00083.html">a Google search result</a>. (I've forgotten the query string.)</p>

<p>This shows to good things of free and open source software:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Find bugs quickly through effective communication between users and developers</li>
<li>Fix bugs quickly through hands-on configuration of source code</li>
</ul></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://github.com/vim-scripts/">Vim plugins on the GitHub</a>, you'll discover even more good points of FLOSS:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Everyone can tune the software to adapt to his/her needs.</li>
<li>Everyone can share and contribute their changes.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>and more ...</em></p>

<p>The more the FLOSS developers, the better our free software!</p>
