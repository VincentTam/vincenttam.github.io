This Sunday, I saw a piece of news which was written in 2009, but I
think that many Internet users *don't* know about its main idea.

{% blockquote Niall Firth http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1220286/Sir-Tim-Berners-Lee-admits-forward-slashes-web-address-mistake.html Sir Tim Berners-Lee admits the forward slashes in every web address 'were a mistake' %}
...the address could have worked perfectly well without the two extra
unnecessary keystrokes.
{% endblockquote %}

Although it is a piece of old news, it is quite exciting to me.  It is
likely that some netizens who usually use a modern browser, which
automatically fills up the type of protocol used on the left-hand side
of the three 'w's in the input URL[^1], find this information useless.
However, I sometimes need to specify the communication protocol in the
URL (say, changing HTTP to HTTPS) for browsing some web contents.
