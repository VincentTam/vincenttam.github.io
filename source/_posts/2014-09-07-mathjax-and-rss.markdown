Motivation
---

In the past, I used double dollar signs `$$` to enclose block
equations.  As a result, readers *couldn't* see them in [Firefox].

**How can these missing parts be put back to the RSS feeds?**

Method

I *didn't* know how to use

1. typeset curly brackets `{}` using MathJax *without* using `$$` to
surround the brackets.  If only one `$` was used, then it would fail.
For example, `$\{a_k\}$` *wouldn't* work.
2. inline display mode for summation, limit, etc.
3. `\[` and `\]` to surround block equations in Octopress.

Now, I know that [kramdown] parses the Markdown source code for a post
*before* [MathJax] does.  Therefore, to mean a backslash '\\', one
needs to "double the effort".  (i.e. use `\\{a_k\\}` for $\\{a_k\\}$)
Moreover, I have to use backslash '\\' to escape askterisks `*` and
underscores `_`.

Before I upgraded to Ruby 2 and updated my Octopress source code[^1],
`$\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} = 0$` *didn't* work.
Now, I can insert inline display equations like
$\displaystyle \lim\_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} = 0$.

With reference to an example on the MathJax CDN, I've learnt to use
`begin{equation}` just like what $\rm \LaTeX$ users do.[^2]  When
using it, there's *no* need to use `$$` to surround it.

Viewing [`MathJaxLocal.js`][JSEg] on *DrZ.ac*, I know why I *couldn't*
use `\[` for a block equation---I *didn't* add it to the corresponding
list of delimiters in `displayMath`.  Actually, at that line, the
whitespace character between two square brackets `[` *aren't*
necessary.[^3]

While editing a multi-line block equation in a post about the
Contraction Mapping Principle, I encountered a technical problem:
there's *no* newline character in the equation.  I could just see
*one very long line*.  To see how the code was interpreted, I made a
screenshot of Firefox before MathJax loaded.

It was evident that putting four backslashes at the end of lines for a
line break *wasn't* enough.  Therefore, I put *two more* backslashes
there.  This time, the page for an individual post was OK, but the
contents in the blog index page and those under folder `/posts/`
*wasn't*.  I viewed the "$\rm \TeX$ Commands" from the popup menu, and
saw that in the page for an individual post, *two* backslashes were
found; at `/posts/*` and the blog index page, *only one* backslash was
found.

By trial, I finally used *eight* backslashes in the Markdown source
files for a post for a line break.

The source code for a block equation can now be seen in RSS feeds.
