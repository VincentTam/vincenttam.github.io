Background
---

On 24th, January, it's [the 151th birthday of Wilbur Scoville][bday].
In the starting page of [Chromium], a game was shown.  I played the
game out of curiosity.

Problem
---

**How to beat the final boss of this game?**

<picture class="fancybox" title="Final boss beaten">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/Scoville/fort640.png"

Solution

Zoom in the web page so that the target is enlarged.  This allows you
to hit closer to the centre, which enables larger damage to the boss.
