Problem
---

I tried opening a PDF file with the freeware Adobe Reader.  Unluckily,
Blocked by the popup window below, I *couldn't* view the content of
the file.

<picture class="fancybox" title="The default is the 3rd choice.">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/AdbRdr/opt3.png"
    media="(min-width: 790px)"></source> 
  <img alt="The default is the 3rd choice." width="300"
    src="/images/posts/AdbRdr/opt3.png" />
</picture>

I then attempted to open this file by checking the first or the second
radio button.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Neither of the 1st nor the 2nd worked.">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/AdbRdr/opt1.png"
    media="(min-width: 790px)"></source> 
  <img alt="Neither of the 1st nor the 2nd worked." width="300"
    src="/images/posts/AdbRdr/opt1.png" />
</picture>

Unfortunately, either choice gave rise to the *same* error.

![Fatal Error][opt1a]

Result
---

I opened the file in *another* desktop machine.

[opt1a]: /images/posts/AdbRdr/opt1a.png "Acrobat failed to load its Core DLL"
