I've just read a piece of news about M$'s Internet Explorer on
examiner.com.[^1]  {" The U.S. authorities has advised Internet users
to avoid using IE. "}  As can be seen in the news, the security
problem had not yet been fixed.  Even though some experts have it
fixed, I *won't* use IE anymore on my desktop, which runs on
[GNU/Linux][gnu_linux].
