Searching symbols in
[CTAN's Comprehensive $\rm \LaTeX$ Symbol List][SymList] is
time-consuming.  For example, when I was writing my
[previous post][pp] about groups, I made use of angle brackets and the
'$\circ$' symbol for composition of two functions.  At first, I typed
`<` and `>`, but they *didn't* look good.  In fact, one should use
'$\langle$'.[^1]  How can one find the commands for those characters?
Detexify is the answer for commonly used symbols.
