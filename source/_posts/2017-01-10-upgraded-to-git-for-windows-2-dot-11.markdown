Background
---

This [Git for Windows][git4win] upgrade from v2.8 to v2.11 is an
*unsuccessful* attempt to fix a [Jekyll preview error][pp] on
[my another blog][blog2] triggered by the command `jekyll serve` for
local preview.

Problem
---

After the update, I can no longer input letters with accents.  Since
the name of some mathematical theorems have accents, like l'HÃ´pital's
Rule.  It would be very inconvenient if the internation keyboard
*can't* be used in Git Bash.

Solution
---

In Git Bash, `locale` returns several lines.  The first one says
`LANG=C`.  After viewing the list with `locale -a`, I've finally
chosen the most common option with the character encoding UTF-8.  To
make this change permanent for one user, add the last line into
`~/.bashrc`.

{% codeblock lang:sh Locale change http://bit.ly/2iAnlq9 Reference %}
# Change Locale Permanently
export LANG=en_US.utf8
{% endcodeblock %}

Lessons learnt
---

Many popular URL shorteners like [Bitly](bit.ly) and
[Google URL Shortener](goo.gl) *won't* afftect my SEO, so I can use
shortened URLs in the [markdown][md] syntax for
[Octopress codeblocks][cb] to save disk space.[^seo]
