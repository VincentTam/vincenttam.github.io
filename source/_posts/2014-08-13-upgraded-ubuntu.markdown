I've upgraded [Ubuntu] to 14.04 LTS.

![tty1 of Ubuntu 14.04][tty1]

In the first reboot, I saw a few
errors.  Since then, usual things like web browsers and terminal have
run smoothly, except the tool tip text of the [Firefox] icon in the
[Unity] desktop environment.

At first, the time *wasn't* synchronized with the Internet, though it
had been set to "Automatically from the Internet" in "Time & Date" in
"Systems Settings".  After an hour or so, it'll be fine.

However, the display of monospaced fonts in some places is strange.
For example, when I view the source code of a web page in Google
[Chrome], the font *isn'* monospaced.

![HTML source code viewed inside Chrome][src_code]

I *won't* try to fix the problem since I think that metric spaces are
more *interesting* than technical problems.
