I've upgraded [Ubuntu] to 14.04 LTS.  In the first reboot, I saw a few
errors.  Since then, usual things like web browsers and terminal have
run smoothly, except the tool tip text of the [Firefox] icon in the
[Unity] desktop environment.

At first, the time *wasn't* synchronized with the Internet, though it
had been set to "Automatically from the Internet" in "Time & Date" in
"Systems Settings".  After an hour or so, it'll be fine.
