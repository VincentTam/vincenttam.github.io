*Note: This post won't make sense here. Refer to the
[original post][op].*

Note: I can now figure out a way to work with *both* UltraBlog and
WordPress.com's built-in online code highlighter.  See my
[newer post][np] for details.

[Markdown] is easy to write.  <del>However, writing code with `code`
tag (surrounded with `[]`) using UltraBlog in Vim *doesn't* work.  In
order to post some code, one needs to
[use 3 backticks][use3backticks].</del>  (I've found a way to use the
built-in SyntaxHighlighter now because I've realised that a blank line
in Markdown will be changed to a `<p>` tag in HTML.  Thus, *don't* put
any blank lines right above and below the the `<code>` tags.)

{% codeblock lang:js %}
element1 = document.getElementById("foo");
element1.innerHTML = "Hello world!";
{% endcodeblock %}

There's some shortcomings of the above method.  If you need to copy a
list of source code, you'll need to browse the source code, provided
that the "gutter" option of the code list is "true",
[which is the default][default].
Moreover, if you include source code that consists of `<angled
blocks>` in a blog post written in Markdown using the UltraBlog
plugin, then the angled block may be interpreted as an HTML tag
element, such as the statement `#include <iostream>` in a C++ program.
*More importantly, I've found out that [this apporach][fail_way]
**doesn't** work with UltraBlog.*  <del>The above code list verifies
this assertion.<del>

<small>Figure 1: This is a screenshot of the "code list" in
UltraBlog.vim.  [Markdown quick reference][md_quick_ref] suggests the
use of 3 backticks.</small>

<small>Figure 2: The above figure shows how the source code for the
"code list" (in lines 12â€“15 in UltraBlog.vim, see Figure 1) is
interpreted.</small>

If you're a [Blogger] user who has made use of [SyntaxHighlighter] to
share your source code online, you'll know that the copy function
depends on [Adobe Flash].  I *don't* have time to figure out whether
this is [a JavaScript trap][js_trap], but it's *better* if I can find
a way to avoid proprietary softwares.

Moreover, the [languages supported][supp_lang] by [WordPress.com] is
*not as much as* [Gist]. For instance, Gist can highlight code in a
VIMRC file, but the plugin used by WordPress.com *can't*.

According to [WordPress's official support][wp_supp], using Gist
should be much easier. The following is the result.
