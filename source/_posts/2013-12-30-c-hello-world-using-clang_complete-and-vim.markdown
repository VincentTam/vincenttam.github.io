Many posts on the advantages of [clang_complete] have already been
posted.  For example, there's [a demonstration of the plugin][demo] on
Mac.  If you can understand Chinese (or you have a translator that
*truly* understands it), you may even look at more sites, such as
[Chen's post][Chen].

The authors of the above posts are likely to work in the IT sector.
For new comers of programming, they may like to start from zero.  On
which platform can they start from? I'd recommend popular \*nix
distributions (e.g.  Debian-based/Fedora-based ones) due to their
package managing tools like [APT] or [YUM].  For a M\$ Vis\* Stu\*
like code completion on [Vim], [clang_complete] is the right answer,
but it is often hard to install on M\$ Win\*, but the installation is
incredibly easy on \*nix.[^inst_ms][^inst_nix]

Many writers of posts on [clang_complete] installation stopped
writing further after completing the whole installation and
configuration of the plugin, and I haven't seen any post that uses
"hello world" as an example.  This is alright since many users of
[Vim] are experienced programmers who would like to demonstrate some
advanced features of the editor with the additional plugin (e.g.
jumping between ctags), and a simple `hello.cpp` can't be used for
that.  Moreover, many teachers would teach programming on M\$ Win\*,
and even if a \*nix desktop is used, the work is most likely done
using an IDE on GUI  ([Emacs] is a text editor and IDE that runs on
command line.)  ...  The concept of modal editing may be too hard for
newbies to accept it, and you need to get several commands right
before entering any text into a buffer.  The steep learning curve
might frighten learners away from [Vim]...  Some computer users
believe in the myth that [Vim] and [Emacs] are too old and nobody use
them.

Anyways, the mixed use of both the built-in omni-complete function of
[Vim] \(invoked by `<C-n>` or `<C-p>`\) and the popup menu of
[clang_complete] \(invoked by `<C-x><C-u>`\) to write a "hello world"
program is a productive way of doing the job.  However, due to the
limitations of human mind, we can remember very few unfamiliar things
at a time.  This is not the case in storage devices.  They can capture
every word that come out of our mind, though many physical means of
storage of information are subject to aging, especially those in the
past...  Luckily, information technology allows words, and even fonts,
to be replicated efficiently and almost identically.  This has brought
the human race a variety of new subjects, such as web \*ng, and has
extended our old knowledge into many fields, such as typography...  In
addition, the advancement of technology enables us to capture visible
images and copy it rapidly, and I've recorded my experience of "hello
world" using [clang_complete] with [Vim] on a series of screenshots.

In addition to adding Wu's custom VIMRC configuration for
[clang_complete], I've also installed [vim-snipmate] and
[vim-snippets] for more auto-complete mappings.[^wu]

Before actually beginning the steps for writing a "hello world", we
should know that we *won't* learn anything from successes.  It's
*failures* that help us reflect on the mistakes in our understand of
theories.  Therefore, I'll *deliberately* find something wrong, and
elaborate on that using some ideas.  In other words, that's "to blow
water" in Cantonese.

Ⅰ. Comparison between clang\_complete and the editor's built-in completion in typing `#include<iostream>`
---

### Ⅰ.1 The editor's built-in completion

The following "hello world" procedure contains some *wrong* steps.

{% img fancybox /images/posts/ClangComplete/inc_complete.gif 800 'Figure 1' 'fig1' %}

1.  Type `inc<Tab>`.
2.  [Vim-snippets] complete the code, with `stdio.h` as default.  The
    file name of the included file is selected so that you can input
    something else.
3.  Since `cout` is used later, we need to `#include<iostream>`.
    First type `io` to override the default input.
4.  Type `<C-n>` or `<C-p>` to get a completion list.
5.  Select `iostream` (without 's').
6.  Continue typing the whole program, and compile it.
7.  The source code fails!

Obviously, there's a syntax error at the line `#include<iostream>`.
Thinking about the auto-completion function again, one will notice
that the correct step is to press `<Esc>` after step 1, and use `ci<`
to clear the code inside the `<>` block, that's a good try, but I
personally think that the steps can be more beautiful.

### Ⅰ.2 clang\_complete's solution

This is just a *part* of correct steps.  I leave the remaining parts
of codes of this simple program into later sections.

{% img fancybox /images/posts/ClangComplete/inc_complete_clang.gif 800 'Figure 2' 'fig2' %}

This time, after typing `#` at the beginning of the line, press
`<C-x><C-u>` to use the automatic completion list, and choose the `#
include` option with the `` $`header' `` surrounded by a `<>` block,
*not* a double quote.  Use `<Alt-Tab>` to select the inner `<>` block
and type `io<C-n>` to use the built-in (*not* plugin) function to
complete the code. (The `<Alt-Tab>` keystroke doesn't work in GUI,
since it means changing the window on focus.)

Note: In this method, `stdio.h` needs to be included.  Otherwise, the
built-in insert completion popup menu containing `iostream` will not
be shown.

Ⅱ. Completion of `using namespace std;`
---

1.  Without [clang_complete]: Directly type in everything, or use
    `<C-n>` for *word-by-word completion*.
2.  With [clang_complete]: The completion menu can complete the whole
    line.

Analysis: Finding an item from a menu requires coordination of our
eyes and hands, while typing the code directly requires more memory.
For a newbie, the former should be easier since he/she doesn't waste
time to recall his/her memory.  For a geek, the later should be faster
since the process has been repeated for many time.  Luckily, being the
second in the popup list, the problem of reaction time does not matter
much if one looks at the list from the top to the bottom.  Moreover,
typing the code directly may lead to syntax errors.  This problem can
be overcome if one has the capability to read the error message from
the compiler and to browse code quickly.

{% img fancybox /images/posts/ClangComplete/using_clang.gif 800 'With clang_complete: completion of the whole line' 'fig4' %}

The remaining parts of this post *doesn't* make use of the
[clang_complete] plugin.


Ⅲ. The main method
---

Just typing `main<Tab>` will do.  That's from [vim-snippets].

{% img fancybox /images/posts/ClangComplete/prog.gif 800 'Figure 5' 'fig5' %}

Ⅳ. Greeting the world!
---

If you type `cout<Tab>`, you'll get `std::cout<<  <<std::endl;`, with
the cursor located in between the two whitespace characters in the
middle.  Using a regular expression to delete the `std::` in front of
`cout` and `endl`.

Ⅴ. Getting the indentation correct
---

Modifying the c.snippet file maybe a bit troublesome, and may bring
strange consequences to the plugin.  If you don't have time to study
the plugin, you may not like to bother it.  Manually decreasing the
indentation of the line `return 0;` each time is not likely to be an
elegant solution for [Vim] Lovers.  The actual way to fix the problem
is using the command `gg=G` in the normal mode.[^vim_book]

{% img fancybox /images/posts/ClangComplete/cindent.gif 800 'Figure 7' 'fig7' %}

Ⅵ. Running the program
---

For some newbies, it might be too much for them to digest if I discuss
more on the creation of a sample makefile, which automatically
executes more complicated compiling commands with a simple `make`
command, searching "makefile tutorial" on the web will do.  If you
don't like the clang compiler, just substitute `clang++` with `g++`.

According to Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician, things are
beautiful if they are simple.  Repetition of facts build up our
understanding.  I end this post with a short and simple command that
can be repeatedly used to compile CPP source files with different file
names.  For more details about that, refer to my earlier post titled
[*Fast Compilation and Execution of Source Code*][pp].
