I'm using [Mozilla Firefox] along with some plugins, such as:

- [HTTPS Everywhere]
- [Adblock Plus]
- [NoScript]

These plugins enable users to browse the web more safely.  Anyone who
pursue true freedom should use these to avoid running some unnecessary
scripts that "betray" them, possibly to authoritarian governments.
