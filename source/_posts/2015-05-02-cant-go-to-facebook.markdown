Tonight, I just go to Facebook as usual, and I've just received an
error saying that "server not found" in Firefox.  The screenshot below
illustrates the problem.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Can't go to Facebook">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/NoFB/nofb.png"
    media="(min-width: 791px)"></source>
  <img alt="can't go to Facebook" src="/images/posts/NoFB/nofb300.png"
    />
</picture>
