1. Blogs
    - Accessible anywhere anytime, as long as an Internet connection is
	available.
    - Multiple concurrent users: it can be viewed by *multiple*
	readers at the *same* time.
    - Perfectly reproduced: contents of the blog can be copied into
	the computer.
    - Searching: readers can find information useful for them quickly.
    - Characters can usually be neatly displayed, despite the author's
	poor handwriting.
2. Paper notebooks
    - Subject to aging: oxidized pages will become yellow; ink will
	fade out.
    - Easily damaged: pages are easily torn if the owner doesn't take
	care of the notebook.
    - Difficult for sharing: unless you take a photo of it and share
	it on the Internet, others can't view the notebook while
	you're using it.
    - Inconvenient and inefficient to locate information: readers need
	to turn over the pages and skim through them to find the
	useful parts.

Privacy of the shared contents
---

Once something is uploaded to the Internet, it is likely that **the
uploaded contents can *never* be deleted** because

* it's *not always possible to delete the uploaded resources in the
    server*; and
* there's *no absoulutely legitamate way to delete the backups of the
    uploaded resources* at other locations where you have *no* access
    rights, for example, others' computers.

In short, there's *no absoulute privacy* for contents uploaded to the
Internet.  They're expected to (be exposed to the) *public*.[^1]

Usages of blogs
---

They can be used to write something that

- you want to share; and
- you don't mind to shareâ€”it won't be part of your private
    information.

Knowledge and universal facts are typical examples of impersonal
information.
