{% blockquote David Gilbert http://goo.gl/K0eyxH What is Shellshock? The OS X and Linux Bash Bug that Could be Bigger than Heartbleed %}
A serious bug has been found affecting Linux and Mac OS X software, which security researchers claim could be bigger than Heartbleed.
...
Dubbed Shellshock, or the Bash Bug, the security vulnerability is officially known as CVE-2014-6271 and affects the Bash command processor which is used in most Linux distributions, in Apple's Mac OS X, and the Apache web server software, among others.
...
<strong>Which systems are affected?</strong>

Servers, <strong>home computers</strong>, and embedded devices are all vulnerable.

Users running Linux and Mac OS X on their PCs are at risk, but it is thought that the most likely target will be web servers running the Apache web server software.

And this is a big problem, especially when you consider that up to 60% of the web servers out there use this software.

Apache uses Bash to run background applications which process data from users, such as information inputted to online forms. If an attacker was able to exploit this vulnerability by making a web request which included exploit code, they would theoretically be able to launch widespread attacks on visitors to that website.

Ian Pratt, co-founder at Bromium told IBTimes UK: "It's going to impact large numbers of internet-facing linux/unix/OS X systems as bash has been around for many years and is frequently used as the 'glue' to connect software components used in building applications. Vulnerable network-facing applications can easily be remotely exploited to allow an attacker to gain access to the system."

In response to this bug, I've just checked if the bash on my Ubuntu
desktop is safe.[^1]  Actually, the necessary updates have been
installed in the system.

Problem
---

I've also installed Fedora 17 two years ago.[^2]  Nowadays, it's *no*
longer maintained by the package managers, who look after packages for
newer versions of the GNU/Linux distribution.[^3]

**How can one fix the bash on Fedora 17?**

I searched "shellshock fedora" on Google, and have learnt more about
the security hole in *Fedora Megazine*.[^4]

Solution
---

I googled 'shellshock "fedora 17"', and found the solution in the
fourth search result.[^5]  The instructions are easy to understand and
follow.  I could manually update the bash in less than half an hour.

If one *can't* find the command `rpmbuild` in the Terminal, then one
can simply `yum install rpm-build`.[^6]

In step 1, there will be warnings about "mockbuild".  I *don't* know
what's that, and ignoring it *won't* cause any troubles.

Step 6 should be the most time-consuming step.  There will be a lot of
output, and much of it starts with "warning:".  At first, I was
frightened and stopped the task after the Terminal remained to show
"warning: SIGHUP" at the last line for more than a minute.  I tried
interrupting the task twice, and then type the same command again to
build the package.  For the third time, I opened the system monitor,
and saw that the CPU usage was fluctuating at the level of a few
percents.  I just did something else for a while, and came back to the
Terminal.  That's what I saw.

From the bottom part of the output, it's clear that I could proceed to
step 7.

    [root@localhost SPECS]# rpm -Uhv /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/bash-4.2.39-3.fc17.i38
    6.rpm --force

       1:bash                   ########################################### [100%]
{:.cli}

Finally, I finished the job.

    [root@localhost SPECS]# foo='() { echo not patched; }' bash -c foo
    bash: foo: command not found
{:.cli}

That's a part of the compiler's output in step 6.

I would like to leave a comment to say thanks to Jan Slupski, but I
*failed* to do so.
