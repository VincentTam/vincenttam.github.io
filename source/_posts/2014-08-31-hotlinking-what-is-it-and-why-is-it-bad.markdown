<strong>Why Hotlinking Is Theft</strong>
Even if You Have Permission to Use a Graphic

Each and every time someone looks at a webpage, their browser has to call up the image host and say, "send that image file over to me." It's like making a phone call.

...Multiply that by hours, days, and months, and then multiply that by the number of graphics on a clipart site. You can see why hotlinking puts a substantial load on an image host. That load is <em>bandwidth</em>, and someone has to pay for it.
{% endblockquote %}

Luckily, I usually download the images and write down their sources if
I use resources from other hosts.  However, I did hotlinked to the
CC-BY-SA icon since I just copied the code from Creative Commons.[^1]

Now, I've got rid of those hotlinked figures.
