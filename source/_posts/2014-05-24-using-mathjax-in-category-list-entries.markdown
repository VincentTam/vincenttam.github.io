Since the update of Octopress source code, this post *won't* make
sense anymore.  I *can't* find a way to use MathJax in category list
entries anymore because `category` in `plugins/category_generator.rb`
and `plugins/category_list_tag.rb` have both been changed to *lower
case*.  I *don't* know how to track the Ruby code to revert it.

About three weeks ago, I successfully changed the category "LaTeX" to
"$\rm \LaTeX$".[^1]  By trial, I discovered that `$\rm \LaTeX$` should
be input for "categories" at the head of the markdown source file of
each Octopress post/page.  Then, previewing the rendered contents at
portÂ 4000 at locolhost, I could see the category "$\rm \LaTeX$"
rendered by MathJax at the bottom of each post/page.  Moreover, in the
category list in the sidebar at the right-hand side, the item "$\rm
\LaTeX$" was also correctly displayed.  However, as I clicked it, I
was brought to a page which titled something similar to "Error 404".
Then, I realized that I need to modify the category list plugin[^2] so
as to fix this error.  I jotted the trailing part of wrong URL down:
"-rm-latex-".

Fortunately, the hyperlink for the category "$\rm \LaTeX$" at the
bottom of each post was correct: `$-slash-rm-slash-latex$`.  This was
an important guide to what was going to be done to the category list
plugin.  As I am *not* going to spend most of my time to study IT, I
aimed at *merely* changing "LaTeX" to "$\rm \LaTeX$".

Viewing the source code of Watson's `category_list_tag.rb`, I observed
that the generated URL of each item in the category list was
determined by the variable `category_url`, and the following method
was responsible for the error.

    category_url = File.join(category_dir, category.gsub(/_|\P{Word}/, '-').gsub(/-{2,}/, '-').downcase)

To solve the problem, I used the following approach:

1. Extract the trailing part of the URL of each category to
`category_string`.
2. Use an if-statement to match `category_string` with the erroneous
part URL: `-rm-latex-`.
    - If it is *not* matched, then do nothing.
3. If it is matched, change the trailing part of `category_url` to
`$-slash-rm-slash-latex$`.

That is, I added the following lines before writing the new item to
the variable `html`.

```ruby Display MathJax rendered $\rm \LaTeX$ code in category lists item goo.gl/CWGBfD View Raw
category_string = category.gsub(/_|\P{Word}/, '-').gsub(/-{2,}/, '-').downcase
if category_string == "-rm-latex-"
    latex_category_string = "$-slash-rm-slash-latex$"
    category_url = File.join(category_dir, latex_category_string)
end
```
