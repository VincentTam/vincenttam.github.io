With this template, I believe that creating a Chinese article using $\rm \LaTeX$ should be *a lot* quicker and easier.

I've tried including a Gist in one of my posts.  However, each line separates too much from another.  Therefore, including a Gist in my post doesn't seem to be a good idea.

I think that the default layout of the code list in Octopress is *much* prettier than Gist.  I included the source code of my $\rm \LaTeX$ essay in [my previous post on $\rm \LaTeX$](blog/2014/03/16/latex-template-for-essays/).  Unluckily, some of the functions in Octopress's code block don't work.  As a result, I have to put the *whole* source file in that post.

In this post, I'll just post the link to [my $\rm \LaTeX$ Chinese template Gist](https://gist.github.com/VincentTam/10473229), and [the PDF file](/downloads/latex_chin_sample.pdf).
