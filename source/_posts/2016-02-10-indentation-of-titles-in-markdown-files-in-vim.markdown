Background
---

While I was writing
[a post about a technical problem encountered][pp2] while writing
[another post about Venn diagram][pp1], I encountered another
technical problem.

Problem
---

I tried including the error message into the previous post by the Vim
editor command `:r ~/temp-swp.mkd`.  To have it surrounded with
`<pre><code>` in HTML, one needs to indent it by four spaces.

{% include_code A section of the error message temp-swp.mkd %}

I usally do this by applying the right-shift operator `>` to the text
selected in visual line mode.  However, the line starting with `#`
*wasn't* indented like the others.

{% include_code A failed indentation temp-swp1.mkd %}

<!-- more -->

Discussion

If I started [Vim] with all plugins disabled with `vim -u NONE -N`,
then the above problem *won't* happen.

Solution
---

Use the visual block mode instead.  Either one way will do.

1. Keep using the `>` operator.
2. Use `I    ` instead of `>`.
