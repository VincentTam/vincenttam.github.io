Why use them?
---

This evening, when I was writing a post about an ImageMagick command that I've learnt, I used the unit "pixel" to describe the dimensions of an image.[^1]  In a measurement, the quantity and the unit should be separated by a *non-breaking* space for the sake of readability.[^2]

<!-- more -->

To illustrate the effect of a non-breaking space, I'll use some screenshots.

### With non-breaking space

{% img fancybox /images/posts/NBSP/nbsp1.png 900 'Move the mouse to the right and click for the next image' 'nbsp1' %}

{% img fancybox noscr nopr /images/posts/NBSP/nbsp2.png 900 'Move the mouse to the left and click for the previous image' 'nbsp2' %}

### *Without* non-breaking space

{% img fancybox /images/posts/NBSP/space1.png 900 'Move the mouse to the right and click for the next image' 'space1' %}

{% img fancybox noscr nopr /images/posts/NBSP/space2.png 900 'Move the mouse to the left and click for the previous image' 'space2' %}

How to use them?

Unlike [pandoc] markdown, one *can't* use `\ ` for a non-breaking space.[^3]

The external URL of this linklog has a link to a *Wikipedia* page which is cited in footnote 2.  From the table in the section "Keyboard entry methods", I can directly insert the non-breaking space character using Linux compose key.[^4]
