<small>The [Gist][src] for the $\rm \LaTeX$ source code of the TikZ
diagram</small>

This afternoon, while I was using TikZ to fill a triangle with line
pattern, I found that the filling pattern flowed out of the triangle.
Using the `clip` command doesn't help.  Initially, I thought it was
the problem of TikZ.  As a result, I tried searching "tikz fill
pattern triagnle", and *didn't* read anything useful.  Finally, I
found [a question on $\rm \LaTeX$ Stack Exchange][latexse], and
realized that it was a problem of the PDF viewer, instead of my use of
the markup language for graphics.  I tried using Mozilla's [pdf.js] to
open the file, but the grids *weren't* being rendered properly either.

Luckily, if I use [`pdf2svg`] to convert the PDF file to an SVG file,
the SVG file *doesn't* have such problem.

    The results are the *same* in Firefox on M\$ Windows and
    GNU/Linux.
