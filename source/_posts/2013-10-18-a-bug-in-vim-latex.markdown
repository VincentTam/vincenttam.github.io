It's a small syntax error, and can be easily fixed with the addition
of a space character.  I found it from
[a Google search result][goo_search].  (I've forgotten the query
string.)

This shows to good things of free and open source software:

- Find bugs quickly through effective communication between users and
    developers.
- Fix bugs quickly through hands-on configuration of source code.

From the [Vim plugins on the GitHub][gh_vimscript], you'll discover
even more good points of [FLOSS]:

- Everyone can tune the software to adapt to his/her needs.
- Everyone can share and contribute their changes.

*and more ...*

The more the [FLOSS] developers, the better our free software!
