<p>I tried to embed footnotes using UltraBlog. Maybe I've done too much things. Let me list them here.<br />
1. On the dashboard, go to "Settings", "Writing" and check the box for using Markdown.<br />
2. Try using UltraBlog.vim to write some footnotes by editing an existing post found by <code>:UBList</code>.<br />
3. Send the finished post to WordPress.com and view the results, and find out that it fails.</p>

<p>It involves several technologies. UltraBlog. Therefore, it's unrealistic to rely on Google search engine to get the answer.</p>

<p>In order to quickly find out the cause of such error, I used the online editor to create a minimum working example of a post containing a footnote. Then I used UltraBlog to download that post. In gVim, I could see that the filetype is <code>html</code>, instead of <code>markdown</code>. I tried to change it to <code>markdown</code> and update the draft. However, the string <code>^1</code> enclosed in middle brackets <em>wasn't</em> interpreted. When I switch the filetype back to <code>html</code>, then things just work again. Just like the text below. I copied them from <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html">the official pandoc markdown syntax guide</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  Here is a footnote reference,<sup id="fnref-503-1"><a href="#fn-503-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and another.<sup id="fnref-503-longnote"><a href="#fn-503-longnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>As I can see from the above block quote, the string <code>^longnote</code> inside a pair of middle brackets will be changed to numbers. In order to let you see it, I post a screenshot of my gVim here.</p>

<p>Note: Remember to <code>:se ft=html</code> before <code>:UBSend</code></p>
