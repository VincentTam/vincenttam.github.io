Problem
---

I had sent a PDF file to a printer for printing.  Then I was waiting
for a person to finish her priting job.  Unfortunately, an error
occured, and she left *without* saying a word.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Adobe RdrCEF has stopped working">
  <source srcset="source/images/posts/PrinterError/20160314_191831_HDR.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 525px)"></source> 
  <img alt="Adobe RdrCEF has stopped working" width="300"
    src="source/images/posts/PrinterError/20160314_191831_HDR.jpg" />
</picture>

Result
---

If I press the "Stop" button to continue with my work, she *wouldn't*
be able to know what's wrong.  *Not* hoping to get into any trouble
with her, I had sent the job to *another* printer.  I had finally got
my copy of the document and returned home.
