I seldom encounter problems in both operating systems.  However,
there're *exceptional* situations.

M\$ Win\* 7

I once booted into its "safe mode", and experienced some problems
during an image upload.  I *don't* wish to learn more about the
problem.

Ubuntu 14.04

Last night, I saw a small dialog box after the login.

I checked the details---it was the problem of Ubuntu's greeter, but
I'm going to do *nothing* to resolve it.

I think that this is due to my method of getting the newer version of
Ubuntu---upgrading instead of clearing and installing.[^UpUb]

Since I lack time to study the official manual and related posts about
clearing Linux partitions and installing UbuntuÂ 14.04, I just keep
using the Ubuntu that I have.

I'm *not* going to argue whether GNU/Linux is better than M\$ Win\*.
There's already *lots of* posts on that issue.

I just want to say that problems *can* exist in *any* OS.  If you
*don't* intentionally break things and your machine still goes wrong,
then "keep calm and carry on".  However, if it's free software and you
have the patience and ability to browse its source code, you may see
what's wrong.

It's great to learn what's really going on in an OS, and I personally
think that the GNU/Linux commands are better tools for that, when
compared to their GUI counterparts.
