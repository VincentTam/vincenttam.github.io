title: "A Non-surjective Embedding Mapping a Field to Itself"

A week ago, I came up with an injective, but *not surjective*
homomorphism which mapped a field to the same field: $\phi:
\rationals(e) \to \rationals(e)$ defined by $\phi(e) = e^2$ and
$\left.\phi\right|\_\rationals = \id\_{\rationals}$.  It *isn't*
surjective because $\phi\[\rationals(e)\] = \rationals(e^2) \subsetneq
\rationals(e)$

Obviously, this kind of mapping *wasn't* defined on a finite field.

After that, I found another non-surjective embedding which sends field
$\integers\_p \[y\]$, where $y$ is an indeterminate, to itself on
Mathematics Stack Exchange.[^mathse91688]

From this, I've understood that why the Isomorphism Extension Theomrem
*doesn't* apply to transcendental field extensions.
