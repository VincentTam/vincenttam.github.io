A week ago, I came up with an injective, but *not surjective*
homomorphism which mapped a field to the same field: $\phi: \Q(e) \to
\Q(e)$ defined by $\phi(e) = e^2$ and $\left.\phi\right|\_\Q =
\id\_{\Q}$.  It *isn't* surjective because $\phi\[\Q(e)\] = \Q(e^2)
\subsetneq \Q(e)$

Obviously, this kind of mapping *wasn't* defined on a finite field.

After that, I found another non-surjective embedding which sends field
$\Z\_p \[y\]$, where $y$ is an indeterminate, to itself on Mathematics
Stack Exchange.[^mathse91688]

From this, I've understood that why the Isomorphism Extension Theomrem
*doesn't* apply to transcendental field extensions.
