Background

Same as my recent post [*Writting Letter With Bibliography*][pp1].

Problem
---

How to add a scanned signature to a $\rm \LaTeX$ document for the
`lettre` class?

My attempt

Searching "latex letter signature", I quickly find an article on
[texblog][sol].  If the `\name{}` has been defined at the beginning of
the letter, then adding `\forname` below the line

    \fromsig{\includegraphics[scale=1]{signature.jpg}} \\

will give you *another* name, and `{Your name}` will give you the
third one.  Moreover, the alignment of the sender's name *isn't*
right.

According to the documentation of `lettre`, the `\signature{}` command
accepts *only text* as its arguments.  I try redefining it, but the
alignment is still *wrong*.  As a result, I decided to do it the
*dirty* way:  I recalled the method of adding the sender's name at the
closing part in [Bio Teckna's model letter][modele].  The
`\begin{center}` environment is used.  However, to make it look like a
French letter, I used `\hspace{8cm}` to adjust the horizontal spacing.
