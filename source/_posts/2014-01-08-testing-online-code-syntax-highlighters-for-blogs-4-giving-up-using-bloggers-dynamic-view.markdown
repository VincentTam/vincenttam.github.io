There are several reasons for the shift of the template of
[my old blog on Blogger][old_blog] from a dynamic view to a static
one.

Speed
---

Dynamic view takes too much time to load. This greatly slowed down my
editing process on Blogger.

Integration with other scripts
---

It is often quite troublesome to load other scripts using the dynamic
view.

<!-- more -->

For example, due to my poor knowledge in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I
can't understand what's written on those blogs that use the dynamic
view and manage to integrate with [google-code-prettify] and/or
[highlight.js] work(s), such as
[Conrad's syntax highlight demo page][conrad_samp] and
[Wood's tutorial on usinghighlight.js][wood_tut]. For details of my
integration failure, you may see the last paragraph of
[my previous post][pp]. 

As I'm *not* a web developer or a web designer, it's *not* worth
spending so much time to goggle the solution. In contrast to the
difficulty of installing external scripts in the dynamic view, the
static view enables users to click "Layout" → "Add a Gadget" to do the
job.

By doing so, the user doesn't need to edit HTML template every time.

Conclusion
---

With a simpler static view, I've been able to make [highlight.js] and
[google-code-prettify] work.
