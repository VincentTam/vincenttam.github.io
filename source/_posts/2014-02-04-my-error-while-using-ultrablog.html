<p>I'm not sure if I've installed UltraBlog.vim correctly a month ago, but it surely improves my blogging efficiency <em>a lot</em>. With Vim's keystroke, I can move the cursor quickly. Such power of "what you think is what you get" is impossible to find in other editors, either the online ones or the offline ones.</p>

<p>I write this post because I would like to make a record only. I can still find ways to work well with UltraBlog.</p>

<p>What are the errors? The following screenshots illustrate them.</p>

<p>I opened a local list and forgot to close it before opening another list. Then, from one of the lists, I opened a new buffer to edit a post. After I finished editing the post, I issued <code>ZQ</code> in order to close the buffer. However, the buffer didn't close. Instead, I got <em>another</em> list. It seems that the plugin doesn't want users to use an "outdated" list to link up with a post. As I tried to close the new list with <code>ZQ</code> or <code>:q</code>, I just <em>couldn't</em> do it. But there's <em>so many</em> windows. OK! Then I just use <code>&lt;C-w&gt; j</code> and <code>ZQ</code> to close the old lists. When I used UltraBlog for the first time, the plugin surprised me by giving me an <em>extra, identical and updated</em> list of contents. Since the first time, the plugin still do the same thing, of course, but I can "keep calm and continue blogging".</p>

<p>Today, I ran into this situation for the first time.</p>

I tried to quit the new list with <code>:q</code>.</p>

Vim told me to use <code>:q!</code> instead.</p>

UltraBlog threw a host of errors that I wouldn't be interested to find out more.</p>

<p>I wouldn't have time to figure out what it really is. <em>As far as I know, if I remember to close all post lists while writing or editing a post, things will be fine.</em> Anyways, just make things work, and blogging with Vim and UltraBlog is awesome!</p>

<p>Note: Actually, <code>:on</code> can clear the unwanted and unaccessible old lists. This can be checked using <code>:ls</code>, which is the same as <code>:buffers</code>.<sup id="fnref-414-1"><a href="#fn-414-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
