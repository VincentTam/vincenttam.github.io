I've explained the reasons for accessing MathJax via HTTPS in one of
my posts.[^1]  About two hours ago, while writing and previewing a
post about bitmapped Computer Modern fonts[^2], MathJax failed to
load.  I found out what's wrong in a minuteâ€”at line 21 of in
`source/_includes/custom/head.html` at my latest commit (i.e. commit
96938d3)[^3], there's a `,` between two referenced scripts: the
official MathJax script via HTTPS, and my local settings and macros in
`source/javascripts/MathJaxLocal.js`.  Googling "mathjax cdn https", I
discovered that in the official documentation of MathJax, the address
for accessing the MathJax CDN had already been simplified.[^4]  In my
opinion, the new URL is better because it's more easy to remember.
