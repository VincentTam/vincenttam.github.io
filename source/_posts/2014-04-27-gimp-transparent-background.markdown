Getting an image with transparent background

### An apple with white background

Downloaded from [*History of the Apple Logo*][apple_logo].[^1]

Thanks to [Ruiz's GIMP tutorial][gimp_tutorial] on
[Mbrsolution][mbrsolution], I can remove the white background of the
picture on the left.

### Using GIMP

It's a brief summary of the referenced tutorial.  To save time, I
won't post screenshots here.  You may refer to those in the tutorial.

1. Use the **Fuzzy Tool** and click on the background.
2. Click **Layer → Transparency** to check if an alpha channel has
been added.  If not, then add one.
3. Produce a transparent background by **Edit → Clear**.
4. Save it as a PNG file.
    - See the detailed instructions in the tutorial.
    - JPEG images can't have transparent background.[^2]

Centering an image in HTML

I've found Mrchief's answer to Web_Designer's question on Stack
Overflow useful.[^3]

Inserting shadows for images
---

Inspired by [ParaImage's tutorial on Hong Kong Silicon][hksilicon],
I've written a small and simple HTML file to practice the concepts
learnt from Stack Overflow and HK Silicon.  
(Click "download" for viewing the HTML code in a web browser.)

{% include_code A small HTML file for displaying pictures lang:html transparent.html %} 

Using Firefox, I can dynamically change the width and displacement of
the shadow of an image by choosing "Inspect Element" and hitting arrow
keys.

- Click the values of a CSS property.
- Move the cursor to a number, then hit ↑/↓ to adjust the values.
- Use ←/→ to move the cursor to another property.
