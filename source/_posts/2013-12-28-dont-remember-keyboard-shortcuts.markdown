Hint: Do not try to learn all shortcuts at once!  The human brain isn't made for that kind of stuff, so you will forget almost all of them.  Rather, we advise you to {" learn the 4--5 shortcuts that you find most useful and use them regularly --- learning by doing "}.  Later, you can come back to this chapter to pick up more shortcuts.  You will soon find yourself whirling across the command line.

I've found this tips useful.  If one can bear this in mind, learning
[Vim] or [Emacs] will be less discouraging.
