Background
---

The crash of my computer in the last weekend motivated me to think
about [using Octopress on Windows 7][octopress_win7].  It is an irony
that the computer had been fixed *before* I could finally build the
site with `rake generate` and start writing posts for this blog on
Windows 7.

Problems
---

Provided that a blogger have some experience in using computers, the
setup should be easy for his/her who wish to start a *new* Octopress
blog on Windows and post simple contents like text, pictures, videos,
etc.

However, I would post something more complicated, such as code blocks
with syntax highlighting.  Having spent time experimenting with code
and commands, I don't want to forget them and it's better to write
them down.  [I prefer a blog over a paper notebook.][prefer_blog]

Before writing anything new, I tested if I could locally build the
site from the `source` branch cloned from the remote repository on
[GitHub][github] on this Sunday, and the first Liquid exception
occurred.  I remembered `rake` said something like this.[^1]

I extracted part of the above message and googled "Liquid Exception:
Pygments can't parse unknown language" for web pages that reported on
similar issues.  It's quite abnormal since `tex` is one of
[the lexers recognised by Pygments][lexer].  In the past three months,
I had successfully generated the site for numerous times, so it
*shouldn't* be the problem of the markdown syntax of my posts.  Having
*no* idea on what the error was, I had browsed plenty of pages. Then I
saw [a question on Stack Overflow][stackoverflow14200637] and realized
that I had forgotten to add Python into the `PATH`.  Following Sam
Lin's answer, I got the *exact* problem as described in the code block
in the Stack Overflow question.

This time, it's *impossible* for me to find the solution in the above
referenced Stack Overflow question.  I tried searching "liquid
exception no such file or directory - python" on Google.  I could find
many pages which suggested me to reinstall the gem(s) or [Ruby][ruby],
but I didn't want to do so since I had just installed them this
afternoon.

I once thought that there's a missing file named `mentos.py` in the
Ruby gem [pygments.rb][pygments.rb].  However, I quickly knew that I
was mistaken.

At that time, I opened lots of tabs in my Firefox.  Even though I had
already known the steps for blogging with Octopress on Windows 7, I
had not yet closed tabs for some related web pages, such as
[*Setup Octopress On Windows7*][tut1].  I went over
[*在 Windows 使用 Octopress–不歸錄*][tut2] written by Tony Jan again, and
the saw the section *安裝 Python*, where I discovered the reason for
this error: Python 3.3 is *not* well-supported by a component on which
Octopress depends.  I followed the advice in the last sentence in that
section and avoided further configurations by changing the Python
version from 3.3 to 2.7.  After downgrading Python, I believe that I
could quickly preview the results.  Nonetheless, I was shocked by
`rake`'s output.

Thinking that the gem `mini_magick` was the cause of this problem, I
realised that there would be *fewer* web pages about this problem.  To
gather more information, I tried googling "liquid exception: undefined
method size", but they *weren't* relevant to my problem.  Learning
*nothing* from the web pages I had seen, I decided to include the word
"mini_magick" in the search query string, but I still *couldn't* find
a useful page.  I decided to be *very* specific and searched
"gems/mini_magick-3.7.0/lib/mini_magick.rb:24:in".  This time, I
managed to find some instructions that I can understand and follow.  I
was inspired by an Ubuntu command in a simple answer for a question
about Liquid exception on Stack Overflow[^2] and finally fixed this
glitch by [installing ImageMagick on Windows 7][imagemagick_win7] and
including it in my `PATH` variable.

    $ sudo apt-get install imagemagick
