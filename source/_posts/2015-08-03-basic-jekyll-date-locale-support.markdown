Problem
---

I tried installing `_plugins/i18n_filter.rb` and `_locales/fr.yml`
from [GitHub][plug_src].  I mistakenly thought that I had finished
changing the English dates on [*Blog 2*][blog2] to their corresponding
French version due to the successful results shown in the local
preview.

**How can one get the locale support for dates on Jekyll sites?**

Possible cause
---

It is possible that the `jekyll` gem installed on my computer was
*different* to the one found on GitHub Pages' server.

A Dirty Fix
---

With reference to [this Stack Overflow question][so29757806], I
manually filled in the name of the months to create a French "support"
for dates in sites built with Jekyll.
