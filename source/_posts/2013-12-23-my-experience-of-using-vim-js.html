<p>To use Vim in other computers, the official website of PortableApps has already provided users <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/development/gvim_portable">a satisfactory solution</a>. The installation size is about 28Â MB (according to the released figure). If you won't have it installed in a portable device and don't want to download and install it into a new machine each time, maybe you can try <a href="http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/web/vim.html">Vim.js</a>. However, I've found it slow, when compared to a Vim program.</p>
