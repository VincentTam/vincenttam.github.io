<p><a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hrl/ihfs/standards/html/C++_naming.htm">This site</a> is what I've longed for. What makes it even better is that it's a website from a domain that ends in <code>.gov</code>, making it a reliable source of information.</p>

<p>Having a good naming convention can greatly reduce the number of syntax errors in the source code and improve its readability.</p>
