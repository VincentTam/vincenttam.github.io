<p>I've found <a href="http://blog.aboutc.net/linux/55/pgp-file-encryption-and-decryption" title="PGP Document Encryption">a page</a> which provides a brief summary of gpg commands. I think some mainland users will find it useful. I hope that I can use these commands soon.<br />

$ gpg -k
$ gpg -K

However, there are some people who find reading simplified Chinese characters hard. I think finding another guide written in Traditional Chinese is <em>much</em> harder than using whatever tool to convert the simplified Chinese characters to the Traditional ones. (e.g. Google Translate)</p>

<p>I've read <a href="http://ckhung0.blogspot.hk/2013/12/safe-encryption.html">Prof. Hung's recent article on data encryption</a>. This article contains many links to other web pages. One of them is <a href="http://newtoypia.blogspot.tw/2013/12/gnupg-pgp.html">his article on GnuPG</a>. In the first item of the reference list in the sixth section of his article, there's a hyperlink of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/zh_tw/gnupg-user.xml">a GnuPG Gentoo user guide</a> written in Traditional Chinese. This guide requires reader to read chapter 6 first, or to read chapter 2 of the GnuPG Handbook. Unluckily, the link is <em>broken</em>. Here's the correct URL:<br />
http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/thuderbird_encryption" title="How to Use Enigmail with GnuPG in Thunderbird">this guide</a> is more useful to users of Mozilla Thunderbird, and maybe TrueCrypt can get file encryption done much faster.</p>

As NOT being an IT student, he/she needs to get "computer stuff" works much simpler.
