Background
---

I created a résumé using [Mik$\rm \TeX$][MikTeX].  Simply copy any
sample document of the "res" class and compile it.  Things will run
smoothly in Mik$\rm \TeX$.

Solution
---

I glanced through the section "[Installing packages manually][doc]" in
Ubuntu's *Community Help Wiki*, and issued the following commands,
after having `res.cls` [downloaded from CTAN][down_file].

    $ mkdir -p ~/texmf/res
    $ mv res.cls ~/texmf/res/
    $ texhash ~/texmf
    texhash: Updating /home/owner/texmf/ls-R... 
    texhash: Done.

Another problem experienced
---

I used Git to manage `res2.tex` on both \*nix and M\$ Win\*.
Sometimes, I used public computers which *didn't* have Git and Vim.
As a result, I edit the $\rm \LaTeX$ résumé with M\$ Notepad.  I know
that the \*nix newline character *won't* break a line in M\$ Notepad.
However, I *didn't* expect that the '^M' character would give an extra
horizontal space in the resulting PDF document compiled by $\rm
\LaTeX$.
