Problem
---

I suddenly found that the Gravatar in my GitHub user profile had
disappeared.

Failed attempt
---

I then went to GitHub to upload the icon.

![screen](/images/posts/GitHubIconUploadFailed/err.png){:.fancybox}

I googled the <span class="grp1">red error message</span>, and read the
last reply in [this thread][src].  Then, I had taken the above
screenshot and started a new post on this issue.

Result
---

Before I finished this post, the Gravatar was back again.

Lessons learnt
---

As *not* being a student/worker in IT, I *shouldn't* spend much time
on developing tools and finding a good solution to a strange problem.
Instead, I should use others' tools to save time and tolerate some
faults, as long as I get the job done.  Developers will work on the
code to improve things later.
