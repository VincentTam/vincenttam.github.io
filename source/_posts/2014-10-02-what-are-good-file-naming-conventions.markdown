Computer users often use the whitespace character for file names.
Actually, this will create problems in the Command Prompt or the
Terminal.

Moreover, I've seen file names with Chinese characters.  Since those
characters *aren't* alphnumeric, there will be a great trouble in
viewing them in a file browser.  How can one distinguish the different
folders named in Chinese in the following figure?

A GUI user can argue that this is not a problem since he/she has ways
to tell the difference between those folders with a Chinese name.

However, it's possible that the computer *doesn't* have a good Chinese
support, so one *can't* view Chinese characters properly in GUI.
Similarly, in order to avoid troubles, characters like 'é' and 'ï'
*shouldn't* be used in a file name.
