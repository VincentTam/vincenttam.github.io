<p>This post is nothing more than a link to <a href="http://ruby-china.org/topics/13350" title="Vim Plugin Recommendation">a post on Ruby China</a>, which recommends some Vim plugins, and I'd like to use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align" title="vim-easy-align">vim-easy-align</a> rather than <a href="http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/align.html" title="Align.vim">Align.vim</a>.</p>

<p>For the rest of the plugins, I don't feel that I need them now, so I won't bother them. For instance, I found the ruler at the bottom of each buffer useful, and I can't see the difference between a powerline and the default ruler.</p>
