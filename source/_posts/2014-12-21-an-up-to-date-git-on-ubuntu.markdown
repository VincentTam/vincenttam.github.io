Background

Tonight, I read the most recent blog article on
[GitHub's blog][gh_blog].[^post]  It says that the version of Git Bash
on my M\$ Win\*Â 7 is *unsafe*.  Moreover, it is claimed that
[GNU/Linux][nix] computers *aren't* affected since they're case
sensitive.  At first, I believed that I *didn't* need to upgrade my
[Git].  However, after I clicked the link for the announcement of Git
v2.2.1, I checked the version of the [Git] on [Ubuntu], and found out
that it *wasn't* the newest one.  The following paragraph convinced me
to get this update on my Ubuntu desktop.

{% blockquote Junio C Hamano http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1853266 [ANNOUNCE] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) %}
Even though the issue may not affect Linux users, if you are a hosting service whose users may fetch from your service to Windows or Mac OS X machines, you are strongly encouraged to update to protect such users who use existing versions of Git.
