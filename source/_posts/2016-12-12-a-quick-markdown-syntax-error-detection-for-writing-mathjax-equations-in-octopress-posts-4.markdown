Background
---

I'm recently enhancing the $\rm \LaTeX$ code for inline limits.  For
the reason of doing so, you may refer to the external link of
[my recent linklog][pp] *Inline Limit Rendering*.

Problem
---

In the previous post in this series written over one year ago, I have
included a code block which enables [deferred MathJax loading][siri].
However, I manually added this chuck of code in the HTML file
generated by [kramdown], which created the problem described in the
next subsection *A problem with Vimâ€™s folding arised*.

Solution
---

Firstly, save the code for loading [MathJax] in [the previous
post][siri] in this series in a separate file `~/script.html`.  Then
use the following commands *within* Vim in order to avoid leaving the
current buffer and to improve efficiency.

    9,$w! ~/temp.mkd
    !kramdown ~/temp.mkd > ~/temp.html
    !cat ~/{temp,script}.html > ~/test.html

The digit `9` in the first command *isn't* exact.  Change it to any
line number that separates the [yaml front matter][yamlfm] from the
post content.
