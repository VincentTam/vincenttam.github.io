When I set up *Blog 1* for MathJax and fancybox, I included some
custom code in `source/_includes/custom/head.html`.  I moved them to
`source/javascripts/MathJaxLocal.js` and
`source/javascripts/FancyBoxLocal.js` because I *don't* like
JavaScript code inside HTML files.[^1]

In the past, I put those code in `source/_includes/custom/head.html`
because of Felix Chern's post.[^2]  However, there's another better
way.[^3]  Why is it better?  It saves thousands of lines of code.
Apart from that, it's a way to separate the behaviour of a document
from the contents.[^4]
