After writing three posts, I would like to stop doing so and watch
some news.  Therefore, I browse the home page of [HKHeadline].  I see
a hot topic on the right of the search button: "Taiwan presidential
election" (台灣大選).  I click on that but no results are returned.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Search results for a hot topic">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/Tw/tw392.png"
    media="(min-width: 400px)"></source>
  <img alt="Search results for a hot topic"
    src="/images/posts/Tw/tw300.png" />
</picture>
