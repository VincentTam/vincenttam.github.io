Objective
---

To browse the web safely.

Background
---

To block malicious scripts from running inside the browser ⇒ I installed
[NoScript] plugin in Firefox.[^1]

Problem
---

Similar to the one described in [InformAction Forums][IAForum]:  I
*couldn't* log on to the web portal of a WLAN.

For ordinary netizens who *don't* have time to read the post on
InformAction Forums, I've prepared a screenshot to depict the problem.

<!-- more -->

When I preview the Atom Feed of this blog at
http://localhost:4000/atom.xml while fixing some layout problems on
those pages[^2], I *couldn't* refresh that page to preview my changes.
As a result, I needed to go back to the homepage and click "RSS"
again, which was quite *inconvenient*.

*Why* do I post it?
---

To share my working ABE settings, which improve the users' experience
of using NoScript and Firefox for secure web browsing.

Why do I post it *now*?  (TL;DR)
---

I've solved the above problem last year and I would like to write this
post.  However, I *hadn't* learnt how to set up Octopress on M$
Win\* 7 when I set up this blogging system on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  Thus,
I *didn't* knew the actual procedures until [my desktop crashed].  The
system failure has caused to seriously learn that.  I started from an
easier target: setting up a *new* Octopress blog on M\$ Win\* 7.[^3].
After that, I cloned the remote repository of this blog on GitHub to
M<span class="tex2jax_ignore">$</span> Win\* 7, and solved some
technical problems before really deploying the site from M <span
class="tex2jax_ignore">$</span> Win\* 7 to GitHub.[^4]

Solution
---

I googled "noscript abe wlan", and the above post on InformAction
Forums appeared on the top.  The second reply solved this problem.
