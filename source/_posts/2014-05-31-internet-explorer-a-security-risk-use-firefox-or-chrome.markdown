I've just read a piece of news about M$'s Internet Explorer on
examiner.com.  The U.S. authorities has advised Internet users to
avoid using IE.  As can be seen in the news, the security problem had
not yet been fixed.  Even though some experts have it fixed, I *won't*
use IE anymore on my desktop, which runs on [GNU/Linux].
