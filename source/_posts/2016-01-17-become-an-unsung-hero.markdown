Several mininutes ago, I was awarded the "Unsung Hero" badge on
[Mathematics Stack Exchange][mathse].  I'm glad about that, and I
hope that this will bring more upvotes to my answers and reduce the
ratio of zero score accepted answers to all accepted answers.  This is
*not* likely to happen though.
