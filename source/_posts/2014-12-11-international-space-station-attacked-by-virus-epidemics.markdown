{% blockquote Samuel Gibbs http://goo.gl/Lrgr7R International Space Station attacked by 'virus epidemics' %}
In May, the United Space Alliance, which oversees the running of if the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> in orbit, migrated all the computer systems related to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/13/technology-links-newsbucket">ISS over to Linux</a> for security, stability and reliability reasons.

That's why I still use a GNU/Linux desktop despite the myth that it's
difficult to use.[^myth]
