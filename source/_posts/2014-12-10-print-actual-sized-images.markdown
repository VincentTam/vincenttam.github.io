Problem
---

A month ago, I wanted to print a picture.  However, I *didn't* know
how to use GUI programs like LibreOffice or GIMP to print images with
their actual size.  I know that this can be easily done in M\$
Paint.[^mspaint]

Nonetheless, as a free software supporter, I should refuse using
proprietary softwares and seek free alternatives.

My Approach
---

I finally used the `lpr` command to print the picture because
*commands won't change like buttons in GUI programs*.

- `lpr foo.png`: print `foo.png` with the default page size, and the
    picture will fit the page.
- `lpr --natural-scale=nn%`: It took me an hour to find out this
    option is the true answer to my question.  I googled "print actual
    size of picture linux" and entered a page in a knowledge
    base.[^kb]  Actually, the contents are the *same* as those in
    `http://localhost:631`.  I *don't* know why the section "Image
    Options" *can't* be found in the CUPS manual.

- One can use `lpoptions -l` for viewing the list of the default
    printer settings, and one may modify it through the CUPS's web
    interface.  For example, one may use the option `-o
    Resolution=Photo`.  Note that it's *case sensitive*.

Lessons learnt

PPI and DPI are *different*.  The former is about the printer and is
independent of the picture, while the later is for controlling the
printing size of the picture.[^dpippi]
