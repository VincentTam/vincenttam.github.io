Two days ago, my Linux desktop was down.  As a result, I had to use a
laptop that ran on Windows 7 to browse the web.  I wasn't sure how
long it'd take to fix the desktop, so I tried installing Octopress on
Windows 7.

I mainly followed [the tutorial on Simple Tutorial Blog][tut1].  If my
blog consists merely of simple passages, the tutorial should have
worked for me.  Unluckily, if any page/post contains a code block,
then [Pygment][pygment], which depends on Python, is used.  Jan
described how he solved the problem of RubyPython in details.[^1]  I
have *no* knowledge in Ruby and Python programming, so I *don't* think
that I can find out what's wrong like him.  Fortunately, I *didn't*
encounter his error.

However, I encountered some errors when I was setting up Octopress on
Windows 7.
