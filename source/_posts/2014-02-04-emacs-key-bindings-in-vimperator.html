<p>I've written <a href="http://blogueun.wordpress.com/2013/12/10/using-vim-keystrokes-in-web-browser/" title="Using Vim Keystrokes in Web Browser">a post about Vimperator</a>, and also <a href="http://blogueun.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/vi-key-bindings-in-emacs/" title="Vi Key Bindings inÂ Emacs">another one about Viper</a>. However, I've <em>never</em> seen web pages that introduce the following Vimperator insert mode commands written by fans of Vim or Vimperator.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Typing <code>&lt;C-a&gt;</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.</li>
    <li>Typing <code>&lt;C-e&gt;</code> moves the cursor to the end of the line.</li>
    <li>Typing <code>&lt;C-k&gt;</code> removes the characters <em>after</em> the cursor.</li>
</ul>

<p>They behave <em>exactly</em> like the keyboard commands in GNU Emacs!</p>

<p>In my opinion, they're just behaving like the commands used in a *nix terminal. Anyways, I've learnt some new commands, no matter where they're used. For a Vim user, it <em>won't</em> hurt to take the official tutorial of Emacs since they can applied once you're in an Info page. For example, if you want to scroll down by one screen in an Info document, you can issue the command <code>&lt;C-v&gt;</code>. To reverse the change, you can type <code>&lt;M-v&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I end this post with <code>&lt;C-j&gt;</code>, though its behaviour in Emacs differs from the behaviour in Vimperator. It's just another way for using the search engine: moving the cursor to the search box at the top right-hand corner.</p>
