Background

While removing the "here"'s in the hyperlink text, I clicked on a link
to my old blog on WordPress.com.  Unfortunately, after 15 seconds, I
*couldn't* see the output.

More errors

I suspect that it was a problem of the server of WordPress.com.  I
think the following screenshot confirm my guess.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Address NOT found">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/NoWP/nowp.png"
    media="(min-width: 685px)"></source> 
  <img alt="Address NOT found" width="300"
    src="/images/posts/NoWP/nowp300.png" />
</picture>

Remarks

This justifies the migration from WordPress to Octopress of
[this blog][blog1].
