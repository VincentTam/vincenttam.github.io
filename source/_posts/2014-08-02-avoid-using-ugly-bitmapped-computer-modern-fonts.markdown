In a $\rm \LaTeX$ guide found on the website of George Mason
University, it's said that Computer Modern fonts can look ugly.[^1]
Like most Computer Modern users, I *didn't* notice that until I wrote
an article using $\rm \LaTeX$ last weekend.

To illustrate the problem, I used a minimum example which I had posted
on Gist.[^2]  To simply matters, one may use
`\pagenumbering{gobble}` to suppress page numbers.[^3]

If one thinks that downloading the Blue Sky fonts from the American
Mathematical Society is too troublesome, simply including the package
`lmodern` will do.

P.S. I have learnt an ImageMagick command from a Stack Overflow
question to convert a PDF file to an image.[^4]
