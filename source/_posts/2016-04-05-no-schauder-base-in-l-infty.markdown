In [a recent post about $\ell^\infty$][pp], I've said that there's a
more direct way to show that a Schauder base *doesn't* exist in
$\ell^\infty$.  This proof can be
[found on Math Stack Exchange][me869754].  It uses three facts.

1. $c_0$ is closed.
2. A result deduced from Hahn--Banach Theorem about a non-zero linear
   functional defined on a closed subspace of a normed space.
3. $x^*$ is continous.
