<p>Hello world! This is the <em>first</em> post I've ever written in UltraBlog.vim.</p>

<p>I love writing with Vim for many reasons, such as it's pointers, marks, macros, keyword completion, etc.</p>

<p>I've tried VimRepress, but this plugin gives me a host of errors that I, as a mediocre GNU/Linux user, <strong>can't</strong> understand. Hope UltraBlog works fine!</p>

<p><h3>Markdown</h3></p>

<p>It's already late today, so I'll practice this new and fascinating markup language next week.</p>

<p><h3>Image uploading</h3></p>

<p>According to the official manual, the <code>:UBUpload</code> command "can only be executed in a post edit view".</p>

<p>This is the first sample image that I've uploaded.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/posts/1stUB/sample.png" alt="$(file)s" />
</figure>

<p>That's how the plugin works. Leaving an empty line after the link for the image does <em>not</em> work.</p>

{% imgpopup /images/posts/1stUB/testing1.png 80% Results of UltraBlog.vim %}

<p>You need to use the concept of <code>id</code> in the official markdown documentation to do a bit of modification in order to get things work.</p>
