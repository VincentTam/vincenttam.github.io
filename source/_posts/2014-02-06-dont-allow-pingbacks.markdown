This noon, I received some pingback notifications.  It is possible
that I get these messages because I included some hyperlinks that link
back to my own posts.  After viewing the contents, I found them
meaningless and wanted to delete them.  Harrison provides the reasons
for *not* allowing pingbacks.[^src]

As the author has said, he will simply delete the pingbacks on his
blog pages.  Moreover, I *don't* want to bother the authors of posts
to which I has linked.  Therefore, I've found the last part of the
official support page useful.[^doc]

> ### Disabling Pingbacks
> 
> You can easily disable pingbacks on individual posts via the
> Discussion module on your Add New or Edit Post page:  
> ![Wordpress.com's interface][img]{:.fancybox}
