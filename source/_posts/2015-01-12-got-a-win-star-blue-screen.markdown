This afternoon, I got a BoD on M\$ Win\*, which *couldn't* be captured
by `PrtSc`.  However, after I've rebooted my laptop, I got this dialog
box.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Recoverd from a BoD">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/BoD/fig.png" media="(min-width: 370px)"></source>
  <img alt="got a BoD" src="/images/posts/BoD/fig-s.png" />
</picture>

Then I wrote a post for that, and while I was writing this post,
*another* dialog box popped up and disrupted my thoughts.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Update M$ Off*">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/BoD/no.png" media="(min-width: 470px)"></source>
  <img alt="got a BoD" src="/images/posts/BoD/no-s.png" />
</picture>

I'm sure that I *won't* get into these troubles on [GNU/Linux][gnix].
