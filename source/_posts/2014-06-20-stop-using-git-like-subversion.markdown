I saw a sentence like "Git does SVN better than SVN does" long ago,
but I *couldn't* remember where I saw it.  Searching the sentence with
double quotes, I found Ben Scheirman's one which asked Git users *not*
to use it just like SVN, but to explore more powerful commands for
branching.

Reasons for using branches:

- Working with multiple features
- Sharing with others
- Merging others work conveniently
