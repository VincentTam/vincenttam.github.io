In my post about proving Pappus's Hexagon Theorem[^1], I inserted some
SVG graphics to illustrate the ideas.

{% img center /images/posts/PappusHexThm/PappusHexThm4.svg 600 %}  
<small>An example illustrating the difficulty of enlarging an SVG
graphics for ordinary users.  The image is borrowed from the post
about proving Pappus's Hexagon Theorem.

**How can one enlarge SVG images *only* within web browsers?**

<object type="image/svg+xml"
  data="/downloads/code/svgpan-1.2.2/PappusHexThm4.svg"
  width="800" height="600">
  Your browser does not support SVG
</object>
<small>A working example showing the zooming, panning and dragging
functions of SVG graphics.  Drag the figure to translate it, and
scroll to enlarge/reduce it.

Thanks to Andrea Leofreddi, SVG graphics can now be enlarged *within*
browsers.[^2]

The instructions on Leofreddi's blog post is quite easy to understand.
Then, I tried his script.

First, I copied lines 4â€“5 of the source code of official demo (a
tiger) to my file.  (i.e. `PappusHexThm4.svg`)  I also closed the `<g
id="viewport" transform="translate(200,200)">` tag at the bottom of my
file.  However, I saw *nothing* in a web browser.

Second, I deleted `transform="translate(200,200)"`.  What I could see in
the web browser was a small picture.  I *couldn't* use the scroll
wheel on the mouse to enlarge the figure.  I dragged the picture to the
right, but part of the image is truncated after the drag.

Third, if I remove `width="152.832pt" height="98.239pt" viewBox="0 0
152.832 98.239"`, then it's done!

Yesterday, I *didn't* know the code for enlarging an SVG image
embedded by an `<object>` tag.  As a result, the loaded image was
*too* small.  I've just checked out a guide on MDN about the
`transform` attribute of `<svg>` tags[^3], and now I know how to make
it bigger by the function `matrix(<a>,<b>,<c>,<d>,<e>,<f>)`.

Moreover, Chrome supports the scaling of SVG graphics just like the
scaling of other HTML elements.
