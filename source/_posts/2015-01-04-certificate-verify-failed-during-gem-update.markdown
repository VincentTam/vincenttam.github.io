Background
---

I pull the Git commits from the `origin` of this blog to Git Bash on
M\$Â Win*.  The `Gemfile` has changed due to commit [fbc3c0b].

Problem
---

I ran `bundle install` according to the official documentation, and
got an *unexpected error*.[^doc]

<pre class="cli"><code><span class="GitHostName">Owner@OWNER-PC</span> <span class="GitPathName">/c/github/vincenttam.github.io (source)</span>
$ bundle install

<span class="err">Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "sass":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    sass (3.2.19)

  In Gemfile:
    compass (~> 1.0.1) x64-mingw32 depends on
      sass (< 3.5, >= 3.3.13) x64-mingw32</span>

Running `<span class="HLCode">bundle update</span>` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
</code></pre>

*Without* updated gems, even though everything in the `source` folder
is *correct*, one *can't* generate an Octopress blog.  **How can one
get the gems updated?**

<!-- more -->

I then tried to follow the suggestion, but received *another* error.

<pre class="cli"><code><span class="GitHostName">Owner@OWNER-PC</span> <span class="GitPathName">/c/github/vincenttam.github.io (source)</span>

I ran the **command in bold** in the above message, and got *similar*
messages.

<pre class="cli"><code><span class="GitHostName">Owner@OWNER-PC</span> <span class="GitPathName">/c/github/vincenttam.github.io (source)</span>
$ gem install rake -v '10.4.2'
<span class="err">ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'rake' (= 10.4.2), here is why:

</code></pre>

Solution
---

I googled "windows unable to download data from https //rubygems.org/
- ssl_connect returned=1", and clicked on the
[first Stack Overflow question that I saw][so19150017].  I quickly
skimmed through the first answer of this question, and read the last
section "Windows note", which referred interested readers to two
places:

1. RubyInstaller issue [249] on GitHub,
2. The second answer of this question.

I clicked the first webpage, and quickly jumped to
[Luis Lavena's response][249rep] to the issue.  Unlike the previous
webpages, I read every word from the beginning to the third section
this time, and read the Stack Overflow question again, before deciding
what to be done.

I followed the instructions in the third section, instead of manually
downloading and inserting the PEM file back to the folder which the
command `gem which rubygems` returned.

<pre class="cli"><code><span class="GitHostName">Owner@OWNER-PC</span> <span class="GitPathName">/c/github/vincenttam.github.io (source)</span>
$ gem install --local ~/Downloads/rubygems-update-2.0.15.gem

=== 2.0.14 / 2013-11-12

Bug fixes:

* Restore concurrent requires following the fix for ruby bug #8374.  Pull
  request #637 and issue #640 by Charles Nutter.
* Gem::Specification::remove_spec no longer checks for existence of the spec
  to be removed.  Issue #698 by Tiago Macedo.
* Restored wildcard handling when installing gems.  Issue #697 by Chuck Remes.
* Added DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA certificate for the cloudfront.net
  certificate change.
* The Gem::RemoteFetcher tests now choose the test server port more reliably.
  Pull Request #706 by akr.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RubyGems installed the following executables:
        c:/Ruby200-x64/bin/gem

<span class="GitHostName">Owner@OWNER-PC</span> <span class="GitPathName">/c/github/vincenttam.github.io (source)</span>
$ gem uninstall rubygems-update -x
Removing update_rubygems
Successfully uninstalled rubygems-update-2.0.15
</code></pre>

Then I ran `bundle install` *again*, and I still got the *same* error
shown at the very beginning of the post.  However, I *could* update the
gems.

To save space in the hard disk, I removed the old versions of gems
with a short and simple command.
