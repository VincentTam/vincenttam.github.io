title: Error of the Font of the Cited URL in Bibliography Using BibLaTeX in APA Style

<p>This midnight, I tried to compile my $latex \LaTeX$ document with a so-called "bibliography", which contains a URL. The link should be in typewriter font after using the command <code>\urlstyle{tt}</code> under adding the <code>url</code> package to the preamble. I googled for almost 2Â hours, but the blog posts suggested that using this method should work. I even tried to copy some minimum working examples from the web to test if they work. They really worked and so I'm puzzled. Ten&nbsp;minutes ago, I just find out what's going wrong: the <code>url</code> package should never go before the several lines in the preamble that are responsible for adding an APA-style bibliography.<br />
The <code>\ll</code> command in Vim-$latex \LaTeX$ seems not doing well with <code>Biber</code>. Whenever the AUX file exists, <code>\ll</code> won't execute <code>Biber</code>, causing the resulting PDF file to have no change in the bibliography.</p>

<p>I hope I can use less time to figure out any mistake next time.</p>
