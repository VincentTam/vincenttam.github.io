<h3>Changing environment variables in vimrc</h3>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Environment_variables">Vim Wiki's page on environment variables</a>. The tips uses paths in <em>nix in the examples. However, for Win</em>, some inexperienced users don't know whether slashes or backslashes should be used. In fact, backslashes should be used, and the string should be enclosed by a pair of single quote (I don't know if double quotes work.) Then things should run. If you're unlucky and receive a runtime error in the next time you start Vim, then it may be due to the missing space characters around the equal sign.</p>

<h3>Writing external commands to files</h3>

<h3>Writing variables to files</h3>

<p>Use the <code>=</code> register. First get into normal mode, then type the following commands.<br />
[code gutter="false"]
&quot;=[sth_to_eval]p
[/code]
The <code>p</code> have to be typed before any further changes of contents. Otherwise, it may not work. For details, see <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8101/how-to-insert-the-result-of-a-command-into-the-text-in-vim">Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange question 8101</a>.</p>
