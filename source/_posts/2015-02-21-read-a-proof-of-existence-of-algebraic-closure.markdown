Background
---

In this Chinese New Year holiday, I read E. Artin's proof of the
existence of algebraic closure, which could be found online.[^milne]

Problem
---

Two days ago, I was stuck at the point where the ideal $I$ of
$F\[\dots,X_f,\dots\]$ was defined.  I *mistakenly* thought that one
needed to fix an arbitrary polynomial $f$ in the polynomial ring
$F\[X\]$ first because the goal of this theorem is to show the
existence of an algebraic field extension $E$ of $F$ so that $E$ is
algebraically closed, and for any nonconstant polynomial $f$ in
$F\[X\]$, $f$ has a root (a.k.a. zero) in $E$.

Resolution
---

This noon, I finally saw "indexed by $f$", and I found I should
interpret "the ideal generated by $f(X_f)$" in this way:

<div class="myeqn">
\[
I := \left\{\sum_{m = 1}^n g_m (\dots,X_f,\dots) f_m (X_{f_m}) : n \in
\Z_{>0}, f_i \in F[X], g_i (\dots,X_f,\dots) \forall i \in
\{1,\dots,n\}\right\},
\]
</div>

instead of viewing $f(X)$ as a *fixed* polynomial in $F\[X\]$.
