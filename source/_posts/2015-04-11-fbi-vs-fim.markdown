This is just a small table listing *some* differences between fbi and
fim.

| | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| fbi | support SVG files | *doesn't* support tmux <br/> *doesn't* have full control over the zooming size |
| fim | support tmux <br/> support custom zooming[^fim_zoom] | *doesn't* support SVG files |

To view SVG images in tmux buffers, one can use ImageMagick's
`convert` command.[^convert]

While writing the above table, I ran into the problem of a Markdown
table with more than one line.  Luckily, searching "kramdown table
lines" on Google, I quickly found a Stack Overflow question which
solved my problem.[^so12119310]  Note that `<br>` is *not* the best
way: add a slash `/` to suppress the following messages.

    Warning: The HTML tag 'br' on line 15 cannot have any content -
    auto-closing it
    Warning: The HTML tag 'br' on line 17 cannot have any content -
    auto-closing it
