This post is *nothing* more than a link to a post on *Ruby China*,
which recommends some Vim plugins[^src], and I'd like to use
[vim-easy-align] rather than [Align.vim].

For the rest of the plugins, I don't feel that I need them now, so I
won't bother them. For instance, I found the ruler at the bottom of
each buffer useful, and I can't see the difference between a powerline
and the default ruler.
