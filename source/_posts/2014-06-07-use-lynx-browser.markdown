Why?
---

This morning, I saw [a post on Search Engine People Blog][CitedPost],
and decided to make a summary of it, so that I *don't* have to think
of the reasons for using [Lynx] when I'm asked for that next time.

### Past usage

- Lack of GUI web browsers like [Firefox] and [Internet Explorer]
- Text browsers were capable of loading contents quickly, if there's
    *no* connection problem.
- The Internet wasn't fast enought for extensive transmission of
    images and flash animations.

### Present usage

- "You really love text and hate images" :)
- "**For marketing to search engines**"
    - "*See what SEOs see*": they use browsers similar to Lynx.

<small>Remarks: Due to my laziness, reasons for search engines to use
text browsers, instead of "a modern browser", are omitted.</small>
