I read this article one year ago.  Though it's written six years ago,
I still think that the part about M\$ Win\* is true.

{% blockquote James Gray http://goo.gl/pjJyNl Go Green, Save Green with Linux %}
Avoid e-waste by avoiding Windows Vistaâ€”a 2007 study by Softchoice Corporation and amplified by Greenpeace stated that "50% of all PCs are below Windows Vista's basic system requirements" and "94% are not ready for Windows Vista Premium edition".  A similar study by the British government found that Linux users need to upgrade their hardware only half as often as Windows users. 
{% endblockquote %}

I hope that there'll be more GNU/Linux laptops available for sale, so
that I *don't* have to face strange problems on M\$ Win\*.[^problem]

[^problem]:
    For example, I *can't* set up Octopress on M\$ Win\* easily, and
    got some errors described in
    [*Testing Octopress and Ruby 2.0 on Windows 7 (1)*][pp1] and
    [*(2)*][pp2]
