Why?
---

With detailed output from the terminal, other users can understand the
problem better.  This helps them come up with a solution to the
problem.

Why don't we use `>` and `>>` to capture the standard output?

Using `screendump`, one can record the commands *and* their output at
*one* time; using `[cmd] > output.txt`, `output.txt` only consists of
the output of `[cmd]`, but *not* what he/she has typed.  (i.e.
`[cmd]`)  The commands are often complicated and more than one line in
length---copying and pasting text from the terminal are thus more
difficult.  Therefore, `screendump` is useful.

Why don't we use `fbgrab` or `fbcat` to get a screenshot of the
terminal?

The goal is to let other know what's in the terminal.   A screenshot
of the terminal is easy to make.  However, its file size is *much*
greater than the screen capture made of text.  Bitmaps *don't* look
good when one zooms in on them with a great magnification.  Therefore,
to achieve the same goal, one may use text instead of images.[^1]

Usage
---

Suppose you want to record your TTY1.

{% img /images/posts/Screendump/tty1.png 'Screenshot of TTY 1 taken with fbgrab' 'tty1' %}

The above screenshot is taken using `fbgrab -c 1 tty1.png`.  Even
though it's cropped, it still has thousands of bytes.  Nevertheless,
if I show it using text, there're only 337 bytes since the text only
consists of 337 characters.

Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-35-generic i686)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

owner@owner-Inspiron-560s:~$ cat &gt; /dev/null
This is tty1.
owner@owner-Inspiron-560s:~$
</code></pre>

The above text is captured with `screendump`.  How to use
`screendump`?  There's a manual page about this tool. The following
examples save the time.

### Failed commands

1. Using `screendump` like `fbgrab` *doesn't* work.
2. Just copying the suggested command *doesn't* work either.

<pre class="cli"><code class="UBMono">owner@owner-Inspiron-560s:~$ screendump 1 tty1.png
usage: screendump [n]
owner@owner-Inspiron-560s:~$ screendump 1
couldn't read /dev/vcsa1
</code></pre>

### Successful examples

Suppose that each of TTY1-6 has 64 rows and 160 columns.

After one issued the command `screendump 1` with *root* privilege in
*another* TTY, the *whole* TTY1 is printed on the TTY that invoked
`screendump`.  Since TTY1 has 64 rows, to view the first line of TTY1,
one needs to use `<C-Page Up>` to scroll up the screen.  The cursor
will be at the bottom.
