Nowadays, people, especially netizens, love sitting in front of a
computer to do their work.  To those people, we can't deny the
importance of computers and the Internet since they help us a lot in
gathering information.  Moreover, a printed copy is often more neat
and tidier a handwritten one.  It seems that working means sitting in
front of a computer or a laptop.

In my opinion, though having low-tech tools, one can still make good
progress in his/her work, including, but not limiting to, software
development work.  *Not* working in the IT sector[^1], I know that
I've *little* convincing power, so I leave it to de Heredia.[^2]  The
article says that the author prefers going out and working on the
problem using a pen and paper.  Therefore, using traditional tools, we
can still create something great.

After reading the article on ViEmu, I decided to write an outline and
draft an essay using a pen and paper.

P.S. I has typed this article in Vim *without* doing any ruff work on
paper.
