Yesterday afternoon, I switched on a public computer.  After the
desktop had been loaded, a dialog box popped up in the middle of the
screen.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Recoverd from a BoD">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/BoD/fig1.png" media="(min-width: 450px)"></source>
  <img alt="got a BoD" src="/images/posts/BoD/fig1-s.png" />
</picture>

I compared this dialog box with the one that I saw on my laptap a
month ago.

<picture class="fancybox" title="Recoverd from a BoD">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/BoD/fig.png" media="(min-width: 370px)"></source>
  <img alt="got a BoD" src="/images/posts/BoD/fig-s.png" />
</picture>

The difference between these two dialog boxes is the button "Check for
solution" on the left of the "Close" button.  I *don't* know whether
this is a difference between M\$ Win*Â 7 Home Edition and Enterprise.
