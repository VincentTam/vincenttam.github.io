<p>As you can see now, I no longer use the dynamic view in Blogger. For a more detailed reason, refer to <a href="http://blogue-un.blogspot.hk/2014/01/testing-code-syntax-highlighters-for_4049.html">my newer post</a>.<sup id="fnref-14-1"><a href="#fn-14-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The dynamic view template in Blogger can already switch its modes according to the users' needs. The containers in "flipcard" and "mosaic" views can be enlarged by a click on them. However, the default "sidebar" view still has its supporters, despite its inadequacies. <sup id="fnref-14-2"><a href="#fn-14-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Last Saturday, I changed the template from a dark one to a dynamic one withe sidebar. However, when I'd like to scroll down to my earlier essays, I found out that I need to go through some passages in between my current position and my target in the scrollbar. This is quite troublesome since a considerable amount of time is needed to load the contents of a blog entry.</p>

<p>Luckily, I could find out how Yoga changed his code in "Add CSS" in his template so as to get the sidebar on the left scrollable. I just copy the code from him for your reference.</p>

{% codeblock lang:css %}
.sidebar #sidebar, .ss{
margin-top: 12px !important;
overflow-y: scroll !important;
}
{% endcodeblock %}>

<p>Note: Later, I found out that <em>without</em> the scrollbar, the sidebar is still scrollable.</p>
