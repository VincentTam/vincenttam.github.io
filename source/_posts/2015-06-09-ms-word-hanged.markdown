Problem
---

I tried editing in M\$ Word, but *failed*.

<picture class="fancybox" title="M$ Word not responding">
  <source srcset="/images/posts/MSWordHanged/word-hang926.png"
    media="(min-width: 926px)"></source>
  <img alt="M$ Word hanged" src="/images/posts/MSWordHanged/word-hang250.png"
    />
</picture>

Solution
---

The solution is extremely simple: *don't* use M\$ Office if it's too
heavy for your computer --- use something more lightweight: a text
editor with a typesetting engine.

### Choose your favourite editors

I use [Vim] every day as a text editor.  I tried [EMACS]. Though I
*can't* remember two sets of keystrokes, the latter is still useful
when you need to browse `info` pages on \*nix.

### Typesetting engines

1. [Markdown] and [pandoc]

    For simple documents which have *little* variation in styles, such
    as blog entries and some homework essays.

2. $\rm \LaTeX$

    For more complicated documents like lab report, documents
    containing math expressions, etc.
