**How to access my USB drive (F:/) in Git Bash?**

I had tried closing all instances of Git Bash and re-opening them
again.[^reopen]  However, it *didn't* worked.

Raison d'être
---

If users can use Git command line utilities in `cmd.exe`, then what's
the point of asking the above question?

*Without* stopping `ssh-agent.exe`, one *can't* pull Git repositories
from the hard disk to the USB drive.

Solution

The culprit is `ssh-agent.exe`.  Killing it will do.[^sol]

Result
---

![result](/images/posts/MSysGitUSB/result.jpg)

The USB drive (F:/) can now be *detected* in Git Bash.

    Killing the ssh-agent.exe process works for me.
