I'm upgrading my [Ubuntu] 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS.  I hope the process
will go smoothly.  However, I saw something like this.

    File descriptor 46 (pipe:[31349]) leaked on lvs invocation. Parent PID 20708: /bin/sh

As *not* a IT student, I probably *won't* find the cause for it for
the next few years.
