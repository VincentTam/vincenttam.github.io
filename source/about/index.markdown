## Introduction

1. A [GNU/Linux][GNU/Linux] user.
2. Have used [LibreOffice][LibreOffice] for homework.
3. Some differences in the appearance of documents across M$ and
\*nix.
4. Use $\rm \LaTeX$ & HTML for consistency[^markdown].
5. Use [Vim][Vim] for efficient editing of source code.
6. Acquired knowledge in these areas.
7. Forgotten some of them since I'm *not* a student in IT.
8. Realised the need for writing down the code.
9. Hand-written notes are *not* neat and *can't* be easily found and
searched after years.
10. Make notes for future reference here.

I have *no* money to hire any IT support person, so I have to support
myself.

[^markdown]: Finally, I've found out that writing in [Markdown][Markdown] is **much easier**.

## My Old Blogs

Before blogging using Octopress, I tried WordPress and Blogger.

1. [My old Blogger blog](http://blogue-un.blogspot.hk/)
2. [My old WordPress blog](http://blogueun.wordpress.com/)

Since I love Vim and Markdown **very much**, I tried using
[UltraBlog.vim][UB] to post essays on WordPress.  However, when it
came to posting code lists, especially the HTML ones, I experienced
lots of problems.  Moreover, it's *inconvenient* to create posts
containing embedded documents and custom scripts.

[GitHub pages][GitHub_pages] provide a greater degree of freedom, but
require knowledge in [Git][Git].  This is not so hard.  With Git
skills, you can post HTML files.  For general users who want to write
words, but *not* CSS, a blogging template for GitHub pages is needed.
Finally, I use [Octopress][Octopress].

## My Videos

I have made only two, and they're on YouTube.

1. [Efficient LaTeX Editing with Vim](http://youtu.be/y67t-05nFD0)
2. [Easy Citing in APA Style with Vim-LaTeX](http://youtu.be/ly8BlePO4ws)

## My Project Pages

<del>
Using Octopress to create **both** a blog and a GitHub project page
under the **same** host (http://username.github.io) is **too
difficult** since they share the **same** `source` folder.
</del>

*Not* being an IT student[^not_it_student], I will get pretty project
page template set up with several clicks on GitHub's online platform.
For details, you may refer to
[*Instantly Beautiful Project Pages*](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages)
written by Boxer.

1. [Hello-World](http://vincenttam.github.io/Hello-World/): A testing
repository.
2. [pandoc_slides](http://vincenttam.github.io/pandoc_slides/): A
repository for some of my slides.
3. [i_dont_use_word](http://vincenttam.github.io/i_dont_use_word/):
Another repository for hosting a slide created easily **without** M$
Office.
4. [recursion_samples](http://vincenttam.github.io/recursion_samples):
A testing repository which contains program code in the `master`
branch and a GitHub project page built with Jekyll Bootstrap in the
`gh-pages` branch.

[^not_it_student]: I reused the words from [my WordPress blog](http://blogueun.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/gnupg-encryption/).

## My Math Notes
As the server on which I put my notes is going to close down, I put it
