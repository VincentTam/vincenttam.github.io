## Brief Introduction

To be concise, I use point form.

1. **Not** an IT student or staff.
2. A free software supporter.
3. A GNU/Linux user.
4. Love text editing in Vim.
5. Enjoy writing in Markdown.

## My Videos

I have made only two, and they're on Youtube.

1. [Efficient LaTeX Editing with Vim](http://youtu.be/y67t-05nFD0)
2. [Easy Citing in APA Style with Vim-LaTeX](http://youtu.be/ly8BlePO4ws)

## My Project Pages

Using Octopress to create **both** a blog and a GitHub project page
under the **same** host (http://username.github.io) is **too
difficult** since they share the **same** `source` folder.

Therefore, as *not* being an IT student[^not_it_student], I will get
pretty project page template set up with several clicks on GitHub's
online platform.  For details, you may refer to
[*Instantly Beautiful Project Pages*](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages)
written by Boxer.

1. [Hello-World](http://vincenttam.github.io/Hello-World/): A testing
repository.
2. [pandoc_slides](http://vincenttam.github.io/pandoc_slides/): A
repository for some of my slides.
3. [i_dont_use_word](http://vincenttam.github.io/i_dont_use_word/):
Another repository for hosting a slide created easily **without** M$
Office.

[^not_it_student]: I reused the words from [my WordPress blog](http://blogueun.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/gnupg-encryption/).
